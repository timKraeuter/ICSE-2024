\section{Introduction}
% Context about the tool --> More high level do not repeat too much regarding section 2.
This paper details the experience of implementing the visual debugger \cite{krauterVisualDebuggerTool2022}.
The tool is available for \intellij and Android studio as a plugin, but its architecture makes it easily adaptable to other Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) \cite{timkrauterVisualDebuggerIntelliJ2023}.

% Motivation for this report?
% Roadblocks hampering full IDE integration: Swing, Tradeoff tight integration and reusability
% Open problems due to IDE integration: Performance?

% Paper outline
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.
We describe the visual debugger tool in detail (\cref{sec:visualDebugger}) and outline the lessons we learned and roadblocks we encountered in \cref{sec:lessonsLearned}.
Finally, we discuss related work in \cref{sec:relatedWork} and conclude in \cref{sec:conclusion}.


\section{The Visual Debugger} \label{sec:visualDebugger}
% What can the tool do?
The Visual Debugger is an open-source \intellij plugin that visualizes debugging information as an object diagram \cite{timkrauterVisualDebuggerTool2023}.
It is available for \intellij and Android Studio through the JetBrains Marketplace \cite{timkrauterVisualDebuggerIntelliJ2023}.
% Why is this useful?

% How does the tool achieve this? Architecture and details.

\end{figure}
% Hooks seamlessly into the IntelliJ debugging process using provided APIs.
% has a debugger integrated into the tool, which is not the interactive and interactive one using the WebSocket connection shown in the architecture. Why two is described later maybe teased here: I don't want to use Swing. Swing tools like yfiles are expensive and unsuitable for "free, open-source plugins" <-- check this claim.

% Feedback for the tool and current vs previous downloads.
So far, we have received only positive feedback regarding the visual debugger, and it was downloaded nearly 6600 times \footnote{Last checked on the 26th of October, 2023, see \cite{timkrauterVisualDebuggerIntelliJ2023}.}.
Our tool's downloads doubled compared to the roughly 2700 downloads on the 21st of Juli, 2022, when we published our research paper \cite{krauterVisualDebuggerTool2022} about the visual debugger.

\section{Lessons Learned \& Roadblocks} \label{sec:lessonsLearned}

% \section{Improvements to the Visual Debugger}
% Going back in time, i.e., showing previous debugging states. Show class/file and line information somewhere in the UI.
% Highlighting changes.
% Smarter UI. Shows if more information is available (colors and icons). --> Colors and overlays can be adapted from BPMN-js
% Go plugin not possible due to lacking APIs? --> Access to the APIs needed to integrate plugins with the IDE deeply. Deeper integration means less portability (to other ides) but a better user experience.
