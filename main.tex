\section{Introduction}
% Context about the tool --> More high-level, do not repeat too much regarding section 2.
This paper details the experience of implementing the visual debugger \cite{krauterVisualDebuggerTool2022}.
The tool is available for \intellij and Android studio as a plugin \cite{timkrauterVisualDebuggerIntelliJ2023}, but its architecture makes it easily adaptable to other Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) \cite{krauterVisualDebuggerTool2022}.

% Motivation for this report?
% Roadblocks hampering full IDE integration: Swing, Tradeoff tight integration and reusability
% Implementing for more IDEs and standard debugging protocols
% Open problems due to IDE integration: Performance?

% Paper outline
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.
We describe the visual debugger tool in detail (\cref{sec:visualDebugger}) and outline the lessons we learned and roadblocks we encountered in \cref{sec:lessonsLearned}.
Finally, we discuss related work in \cref{sec:relatedWork} and conclude in \cref{sec:conclusion}.


\section{The Visual Debugger} \label{sec:visualDebugger}
% What can the tool do?
The Visual Debugger is an open-source \intellij plugin that visualizes the debugging variables as an object diagram to foster program comprehension.
It is available for \intellij and Android Studio through the JetBrains Marketplace \cite{timkrauterVisualDebuggerIntelliJ2023, timkrauterVisualDebuggerTool2023}.
% Motivation
Debugging information might not be present in the top-level variables and has to be obtained by digging multiple levels (following links to related objects) deep into different variables.
Thus, in specific scenarios, especially when data is hierarchically structured, a graphical representation results in a faster and better understanding of the debugging information \cite{krauterVisualDebuggerTool2022}.

Additional artifacts, including source code, a demonstration of the visual debugger tool, and a description of the Visual Debugging API, can be found in \cite{timkrauterICSE2024Artifacts2023}.

% How does the tool work? Give an example and short description merge the design principles part into here and look at the description in the old paper
\subsection{Example}

% Textual figure
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{images/variables.png}
    \caption{Variables during debugging in \intellij}
    \label{fig:variablesIntellij}
\end{figure}

% Graphical figure
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.475\textwidth]{images/variables-visual-debugger.png}
    \caption{Visual Debugger visualization comparable to \cref{fig:variablesIntellij}}
    \label{fig:visualDebuggerVariables}
\end{figure}

% Mention video --> Make 2.0 video. Maybe also make artifacts.

Using the Visual debugger is \textit{straightforward} since it becomes automatically available during debugging in the IDE.
% Familiar
It allows interactions to explore debugging variables in more detail like traditional textual debugging.
% Non-intrusive
In addition, it is \textit{non-intrusive} since it can be used alongside the traditional textual debugging available in the IDE.
% Minimalistic: Less is more


\subsection{Architecture}
% How does the tool achieve this? Architecture and details.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{images/visual-debugger.pdf}
  \caption{Visual Debugger Architecture}
\end{figure}
% Hooks seamlessly into the IntelliJ debugging process using provided APIs.
% has a debugger integrated into the tool, which is not the interactive and interactive one using the WebSocket connection shown in the architecture. Why two is described later may be teased here: I don't want to use Swing. Swing tools like yfiles are expensive and unsuitable for "free, open-source plugins" <-- Check this claim.

% Feedback for the tool and current vs previous downloads.
So far, we have received only positive feedback regarding the visual debugger, and it was downloaded nearly 6600 times \footnote{Last checked on the 26th of October, 2023, see \cite{timkrauterVisualDebuggerIntelliJ2023}.}.
Our tool's downloads doubled compared to the roughly 2700 downloads on the 21st of Juli, 2022, when we published our research paper \cite{krauterVisualDebuggerTool2022} about the visual debugger.

\subsection{Improvements}
We improved the visual debugger by adding two new key features.

% Visualizing changes
\textbf{(1)} The \textit{visualization component} of the visual debugger now \textit{highlights changes} using colors and overlays in the object diagram.
New objects and links are colored green, while changes to existing elements lead to orange coloring.
Computing and highlighting the changes is enabled by default but can be switched off.
\autoref{fig:visualDebuggerVariables} shows the new change visualization by highlighting three changed, and one added object accordingly.
% Motivation
A software engineer is usually most interested in the changes that occur to the objects during debugging.
Our color-based visualization of changes in the object diagram makes it easier for a software engineer to see changes even when dealing with a complex debugging situation with multiple connected objects.

% Implementation
Changes can be calculated efficiently using unique object IDs provided during debugging.
% TODO: the two components should be mentioned earlier in the architecture
We implemented the change detection in the visualization component such that it can be reused across programming languages and IDEs \cite{timkrauterICSE2024Artifacts2023}.

% Debug history
\textbf{(2)} Furthermore, the visualization component now keeps a \textit{debug history} so that a user can see debug information from previous debugging steps.
The debug history's length is configurable or can be turned off entirely.
% Motivation
As described earlier, software engineers are most interested in how variables change during debugging.
Consequently, to not only highlight differences to the previous step, we save the previous debugging information in a debug history.
A software engineer can thus inspect the previously shown debug information and step as far back as he configured.
The visual debugger always shows where the debug information was collected in the source code, and highlights changes compared to the previous debugging step.
In addition, one can still export the debug information to an image or even edit it in our object diagram modeler \cite{timkrauterObjectdiagramjs2023} for documentation purposes \cite{krauterVisualDebuggerTool2022}.

% Implementation
We implemented the \textit{debug history} in the visualization component to be independent of the used programming language and IDE.
Thus, both features follow our aim of providing a reusable visualization of the debugging information set in our previous publication \cite{krauterVisualDebuggerTool2022}.
% Smarter UI?. Shows if more information is available (colors and icons). --> Colors and overlays can be adapted from BPMN-js

\section{Lessons Learned \& Roadblocks} \label{sec:lessonsLearned}

% Roadblock 1: Missing APIS
% \subsection{IDE APIs}
% Is the Go plugin not possible due to the lack of APIs? --> Access to the APIs needed to integrate plugins with the IDE deeply. Deeper integration means less portability (to other ideas) but a better user experience.
% Or it is possible, but the integration would not be nice! Since now, we have two people connected to the same process or something similar.

% Roadblock 2: IDE integration due to IDE UI technology --> See notes
