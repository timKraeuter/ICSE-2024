In this paper, we develop a coalgebraic theory of state-based bx, and relate the resulting coalgebraic structures (cbx) to mbx. We show that cbx support a notion of composition coherent with, but conceptually simpler than, our previous mbx definition. Coalgebraic bisimulation yields a natural notion of behavioural equivalence on cbx, which respects composition, and essentially includes symmetric lens equivalence as a special case. Finally, we speculate on the applications of this coalgebraic perspective to other bx constructions and formalisms.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, business enterprises often need to dynamically reconfigure their internal processes in order to improve the efficiency of the business flow. However, modifications of the workflow usually lead to several problems in terms of deadlock freedom, completeness and security. A solid solution to these problems consists in the application of model checking techniques in order to verify if specific properties of the workflow are preserved by the change in configuration. Our goal in this work is to develop a formal verification procedure to deal with these problems. The first step consists in developing a formal definition of a BPMN model of a business workflow. Then, a given BPMN model is translated into a formal model specified in Promela. Finally, by using the SPIN model checker, the correctness of the reconfigured workflow is verified.},

However, currently there is little support for reusing transformations in different contexts since they are tightly coupled to the metamodels they are defined upon, and hence reusing them for other metamodels becomes challenging. Inspired from generic programming, we proposed generic model-to-model transformations, which are defined over so-called metamodel concepts, which are later bound to specific metamodels. Nevertheless, the current binding mechanism lacks automated resolution support for recurring structural heterogeneities between metamodels. Therefore, based on a systematic classification of heterogeneities, we propose a flexible binding mechanism being able to automatically resolve recurring structural heterogeneities between metamodels. For this, the binding model is analyzed and required adaptors are automatically added to the transformation.},

  abstract = {The complexity of cyber\textendash physical systems (CPSs) is commonly addressed through complex workflows, involving models in a plethora of different formalisms, each with their own methods, techniques, and tools. Some workflow patterns, combined with particular types of formalisms and operations on models in these formalisms, are used successfully in engineering practice. To identify and reuse them, we refer to these combinations of workflow and formalism patterns as modelling paradigms. This paper proposes a unifying (Descriptive) Framework to describe these paradigms, as well as their combinations. This work is set in the context of Multi-Paradigm Modelling (MPM), which is based on the principle to model every part and aspect of a system explicitly, at the most appropriate level(s) of abstraction, using the most appropriate modelling formalism(s) and workflows. The purpose of the Descriptive Framework presented in this paper is to serve as a basis to reason about these formalisms, workflows, and their combinations. One crucial part of the framework is the ability to capture the structural essence of a paradigm through the concept of a paradigmatic structure. This is illustrated informally by means of two example paradigms commonly used in CPS: Discrete Event Dynamic Systems and Synchronous Data Flow. The presented framework also identifies the need to establish whether a paradigm candidate follows, or qualifies as, a (given) paradigm. To illustrate the ability of the framework to support combining paradigms, the paper shows examples of both workflow and formalism combinations. The presented framework is intended as a basis for characterisation and classification of paradigms, as a starting point for a rigorous formalisation of the framework (allowing formal analyses), and as a foundation for MPM tool development.},

  abstract = {Bidirectional transformations (bx) are relevant for a wide range of application domains. While bx problems may be solved with unidirectional languages and tools, maintaining separate implementations of forward and backward synchronizers with mutually consistent behavior can be difficult, laborious, and error-prone. To address the challenges involved in handling bx problems, dedicated languages and tools for bx have been developed. Due to their heterogeneity, however, the numerous and diverse approaches to bx are difficult to compare, with the consequence that fundamental differences and similarities are not yet well understood. This motivates the need for suitable benchmarks that facilitate the comparison of bx approaches. This paper provides a comprehensive treatment of benchmarking bx, covering theory, implementation, application, and assessment. At the level of theory, we introduce a conceptual framework that defines and classifies architectures of bx tools. At the level of implementation, we describe Benchmarx, an infrastructure for benchmarking bx tools which is based on the conceptual framework. At the level of application, we report on a wide variety of solutions to the well-known Families-to-Persons benchmark, which were developed and compared with the help of Benchmarx. At the level of assessment, we reflect on the usefulness of the Benchmarx approach to benchmarking bx, based on the experiences gained from the Families-to-Persons benchmark.},

Reo is a channel-based exogenous coordination model in which complex coordinators, called               connectors               , are compositionally built out of simpler ones. The simplest connectors in Reo are a set of               channels               with well-defined behaviour supplied by users. Reo can be used as a language for coordination of concurrent processes, or as a `glue language' for compositional construction of connectors that orchestrate component instances in a component-based system. The emphasis in Reo is just on connectors and their composition, and not on the entities that connect to, communicate and cooperate through these connectors. Each connector in Reo imposes a specific coordination pattern on the entities (for example, components) that perform I/O operations through that connector, without the knowledge of those entities. Channel composition in Reo is a very powerful mechanism for construction of connectors. We demonstrate the expressive power of connector composition in Reo through a number of examples. We show that exogenous coordination patterns that can be expressed as (meta-level) regular expressions over I/O operations can be composed in Reo out of a small set of only five primitive channel types.},

The algebraic approach to GT is based on category theory, allowing the instantiation of theoretical results to multiple graph-like structures (e.g. labelled or attributed graphs, Petri nets, even transformation rules themselves). There exists a rich theory of algebraic GT which underlies verification techniques such as static analysis. Current tools based on GT are implemented in a very concrete way, unlike the theory, making them hard to extend with novel theoretical results. Thus a new software system called Verigraph was created, with the goal of implementing the theory as closely as possible, while maintaining a reasonable execution time. In this paper we present the architecture of Verigraph, which enabled an almost direct implementation of the theory. We also provide a step-by-step guide to implementing a new graph model within the system, using second-order graph transformation as an example. Finally, we compare the performance of Verigraph and AGG.},

We examine the problem of determining consistent orderings of execution traces in the context of model-driven development of reactive distributed systems, that is, systems whose code has been generated from communicating state machine models. By leveraging key concepts of state machines and existing model analysis and transformation techniques, we propose an approach to collecting and reordering execution traces that does not rely on timestamps. We describe a prototype implementation of our approach and an evaluation. The experimental results show that compared to reordering based on logical timestamps using vector time (clocks), our approach reduces the size of the trace information collected by more than half while incurring similar runtime overhead.},

We formalize in RealTime Maude the semantics of a subset of hierarchical Ptolemy II DE models, and explain how the code generation infrastructure of Ptolemy II has been used to automatically synthesize a Real-Time Maude verification model from a Ptolemy II design model. This enables a model-engineering process that combines the convenience of Ptolemy II DE modeling and simulation with formal verification in Real-Time Maude.},

  abstract = {Cellular senescence, a stress-induced irreversible growth arrest often characterized by expression of p16Ink4a (encoded by the Ink4a/Arf locus, also known as Cdkn2a) and a distinctive secretory phenotype, prevents the proliferation of preneoplastic cells and has beneficial roles in tissue remodelling during embryogenesis and wound healing. Senescent cells accumulate in various tissues and organs over time, and have been speculated to have a role in ageing. To explore the physiological relevance and consequences of naturally occurring senescent cells, here we use a previously established transgene, INK-ATTAC, to induce apoptosis in p16Ink4a-expressing cells of wild-type mice by injection of AP20187 twice a week starting at one year of age. We show that compared to vehicle alone, AP20187 treatment extended median lifespan in both male and female mice of two distinct genetic backgrounds. The clearance of p16Ink4a-positive cells delayed tumorigenesis and attenuated age-related deterioration of several organs without apparent side effects, including kidney, heart and fat, where clearance preserved the functionality of glomeruli, cardio-protective KATP channels and adipocytes, respectively. Thus, p16Ink4a-positive cells that accumulate during adulthood negatively influence lifespan and promote age-dependent changes in several organs, and their therapeutic removal may be an attractive approach to extend healthy lifespan. When senescent cells accumulate during adulthood they negatively influence lifespan and promote age-dependent changes in several organs; clearance of these cells delayed tumorigenesis in mice and attenuated age-related deterioration of several organs without overt side effects, suggesting that the therapeutic removal of senescent cells may be able to extend healthy lifespan. Various tissues and organs accumulate senescent cells during normal ageing, but it is not known whether \textemdash{} or how \textemdash{} these cells influence health and lifespan. Jan van Deursen and colleagues show that when senescent cells accumulate during adulthood they are a negative influence on lifespan and promote age-dependent changes in multiple organs. Clearance of these cells delayed tumorigenesis and attenuated age-related deterioration of several organs without overt side effects. This finding suggests that therapeutic removal of senescent cells may be able to extend healthy lifespan.},

  abstract = {We describe some progress towards a new common framework for model driven engineering, based on behavioral programming. The tool we have developed unifies almost all of the work done in behavioral programming so far, under a common set of interfaces. Its architecture supports pluggable event selection strategies, which can make models more intuitive and compact. Program state space can be traversed using various algorithms, such as DFS and A*. Furthermore, program state is represented in a way that enables scanning a state space using parallel and distributed algorithms. Executable models created with this tool can be directly embedded in Java applications, enabling a model-first approach to system engineering, where initially a model is created and verified, and then a working application is gradually built around the model. The model itself consists of a collection of small scripts written in JavaScript (hence ``BPjs''). Using a variety of case-studies, this paper shows how the combination of a lenient programming language with formal model analysis tools creates an efficient way of developing robust complex systems. Additionally, as we learned from an experimental course we ran, the usage of JavaScript make practitioners more amenable to using this system and, thus, model checking and model driven engineering. In addition to providing infrastructure for development and case-studies in behavioral programming, the tool is designed to serve as a common platform for research and innovation in behavioral programming and in model driven engineering in general.},

This paper aims to contribute in this direction: building on previous work by the authors on coalgebraic refinement for software components and architectures, it discusses refactoring of models within a coalgebraic semantic framework. Architectures are defined through aggregation based on a coalgebraic semantics for (subsets of) UML. On the other hand, such aggregations, no matter how large and complex they are, can always be dealt with as coalgebras themselves. This paves the way to a discipline of models' transformations which, being invariant under either behavioural equivalence or refinement, are able to formally capture a large number of refactoring patterns. The main ideas underlying this research are presented through a detailed example in the context of refactoring of UML class diagrams.},

The complexity of these systems leads to questions about prevalent modeling approaches, their ability to integrate heterogeneous models, and their relevance to the application domains and stakeholders. The methodology for Multi-Paradigm Modeling (MPM) of CPS is not yet fully established and standardized, and researchers apply existing methods for modeling of complex systems and introducing their own. No systematic review has been previously performed to create an overview of the field on the methods used for MPM of CPS. In this paper, we present a systematic mapping study that determines the models, formalisms, and development processes used over the last decade. Additionally, to determine the knowledge necessary for developing CPS, our review studied the background of actors involved in modeling and authors of surveyed studies. The results of the survey show a tendency to reuse multiple existing formalisms and their associated paradigms, in addition to a tendency towards applying transformations between models. These findings suggest that MPM is becoming a essential approach to model CPS, and highlight the importance of future integration of models, standardization of development process and education.},

The modularity results from looking at the system from a number of different perspectives, each dealing with a specific aspect of the system. As a solution a synchronization operator is proposed which glues agent aware systems on shared agents and transitions. The construction turns out to be a categorical product. We also show that a logic to talk about the temporal and the structural properties of the product can be obtained by gluing suitable logical frameworks from the components.},

Given the prolific results during these years, the current outcomes need to be sorted and classified. Furthermore, many gaps need to be categorised in order to further develop the research topic by experts of the research area but also newcomers. Accordingly, the paper discusses the principles and requirements of models@run.time and the state-of-the-art of the research line. To make the discussion more concrete, a taxonomy is defined and used to compare the main approaches and research outcomes in the area during the last decade and including ancestor research initiatives. We identified and classified 275 papers on models@run.time, which allowed us to identify the underlying research gaps and to elaborate on the corresponding research challenges. Finally, we also facilitate sustainability of the survey over time by offering tool support to add, correct and visualise data.},

Big data integration projects enable companies to capture their relevant data, to efficiently store it, turn it into domain knowledge, and finally monetize it. In this context, historical data, also called temporal data, is becoming increasingly available and delivers means to analyse the history of applications, discover temporal patterns, and predict future trends. Despite the fact that most data that today's applications are dealing with is inherently temporal current approaches, methodologies, and environments for developing these applications don't provide sufficient support for handling time. We envision that Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) would be an appropriate ecosystem for a seamless and orthogonal integration of time into domain modelling and processing. In this paper, we investigate the state-of-the-art in MDE techniques and tools in order to identify the missing bricks for raising time-awareness in MDE and outline research directions in this emerging domain.},

Our generic mathematical model of contract supports this style of development. This is achieved by focusing on behaviors, by supporting the notion of ``rich component'' where functional and non-functional aspects of the system can be considered and combined, by representing rich components via their set of associated contracts, and by formalizing the process of component composition.},

The support in modern Java for multiple paradigms increases the need for specific best-practices advice, and this book delivers. As in previous editions, each chapter of Effective Java, Third Edition, consists of several "items," each presented in the form of a short, stand-alone essay that provides specific advice, insight into Java platform subtleties, and updated code examples. The comprehensive descriptions and explanations for each item illuminate what to do, what not to do, and why. The third edition covers language and library features added in Java 7, 8, and 9, including the functional programming constructs that were added to its object-oriented roots. Many new items have been added, including a chapter devoted to lambdas and streams. New coverage includes Functional interfaces, lambda expressions, method references, and streams Default and static methods in interfaces Type inference, including the diamond operator for generic types The @SafeVarargs annotation The try-with-resources statement New library features such as the Optional interface, java.time, and the convenience factory methods for collections Register your product at informit.com/register for convenient access to the web edition eBook, updates, and/or corrections as they become available},

ModHel'X relies on component based modeling and models of computation to address these problems and focuses on the computation of one possible behavior of a model. This includes simulation and code generation. ModHel'X defines a MOF meta-model for describing the structural elements of a modeling language. The semantics of modeling languages is expressed in an imperative style and addresses three aspects: control, data and time. ModHel'X is supported by a simulator of multi-formalism models.},

Recent efforts in language workbenches result in advanced frameworks that automatically provide syntactic tooling such as advanced editors. However, defining the execution semantics of languages and their tooling remains mostly hand crafted. Similarly to editors that share code completion or syntax highlighting, the development of advanced debuggers, animators, and others execution analysis tools shares common facilities, which should be reused among various DSMLs. In this tool demonstration paper, we present the execution framework offered by the GEMOC studio, an Eclipse-based language and modeling workbench. The framework provides a generic interface to plug in different execution engines associated to their specific metalanguages used to define the discrete-event operational semantics of DSMLs. It also integrates generic runtime services that are shared among the approaches used to implement the execution semantics, such as graphical animation or omniscient debugging.},

  abstract = {As the Web becomes a platform for implementing complex B2C and B2B applications, the need arises of extending Web conceptual modeling from data-centric applications to data- and process-centric applications. New primitives must be put in place to implement workflows describing business processes. In this context, new problems about process safety and verification arise. We study Web sites interacting with users or applications. We provide a formal data-driven model of the application, which can access an underlying database, as well as state information updated as the interaction progresses, and a set of user input. Against this Web application definition, we aim at verifying properties concerning the sequences of events, inputs, states, and actions, resulting from the interaction. In particular, we focus on workflow based properties, describing the execution flow of the tasks within the application. Such properties are expressed in linear or branching-time temporal logics. Since temporal logics properties are difficult to describe by a user, this work presents a visual approach that exploits and extends workflow notations (in particular, BPMN) for describing the rules to be verified. Some results from the same research group involved in this work establish under what conditions automatic verification of such properties is possible and provide the complexity of verification.},

  abstract = {Most modeling and simulation (M\&S) questions about cyber-physical systems (CPSs) require expert skills belonging to different scientific fields. The challenges are then to integrate each domain's tools (formalism and simulation software) within the rigorous framework of M\&S process. To answer this issue, we give the specifications of the Multi-agent Environment for Complex-SYstem CO-simulation (MECSYCO) middleware which enables to interconnect several pre-existing and heterogeneous M\&S tools, so they can simulate a whole CPS together. The middleware performs the co-simulation in a parallel, decentralized, and distributable fashion thanks to its modular multi-agent architecture. In order to rigorously integrate tools that use different formalisms, the co-simulation engine of MECSYCO is based on the discrete event system specification (DEVS). The central idea of MECSYCO is to use a DEVS wrapping strategy to integrate each tool into the middleware. Thus, heterogeneous tools can be homogeneously co-simulated in the form of a DEVS system. By using DEVS, MECSYCO benefits from the numerous scientific works which have demonstrated the integrative power of this formalism and give crucial guidelines to rigorously design wrappers. We demonstrate that our discrete framework can integrate a vast amount of continuous M\&S tools by wrapping the Functional Mockup Interface (FMI) standard. To this end, we take advantage of DEVS efforts of the literature (namely, the DEV\&DESS hybrid formalism and Quantized State System (QSS) solvers) to design DEVS wrappers for Functional Mockup Unit (FMU) components. As a side-effect, this wrapping is not restricted to MECSYCO but can be applied in any DEVS-based platform. We evaluate MECSYCO with the proof of concept of a smart heating use case, where we co-simulate non-DEVS-centric M\&S tools.},

However, when heterogeneous and independent DSLs are used to define these models, there is a need to explicitly compose their semantics. While the composition of static semantics of DSLs is straightforward, the coordination of their execution semantics is still challenging. This issue is generally called inter-DSL collaboration. In this paper, we propose a formal Model Driven Engineering (MDE) framework built on the Meeduse language workbench that we extend with the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN). Meeduse allows to instrument DSLs with formal semantics using the B method. BPMN provides an easy-to-use notation to define the coordination of execution semantics of these DSLs. A transformation of BPMN models into Communication Sequential Process (CSP) formal language enables the possibility for animation and verification. Our approach is successfully demonstrated by modeling the collaboration of two DSLs from a real case study.},

The complexity of today software systems requires separation of coordinating entities from computational entities and runtime coordination. The paper presents a coordination framework that divides the system into coordinators and computational entities. The computational entities are represented as roles, processes and services so as to provide coordination with fine granularity. The coordinators are responsible for coordination among the roles. In our framework, coordinators are divided into three types: resource coordinator, communication coordinator and task coordinator. A set of general purposed data table I/O APIs are developed for relational databases, and some frequently used table I/O manipulations are provided as templates. In the paper, the strategies of coordination-oriented software development are discussed. A coordination framework based application development approach is proposed by a practical Commodity Trading System.},

However, there are still challenges hindering the wide-scale industrial application of model-based design. One of these unsolved problems is the lack of a practical, effective method for the formal specification of DSML semantics. This problem has negative impact on reusability of DSML-s and analysis tools in domain specific tool chains. To address these issues, we propose a formal well founded methodology with supporting tools to anchor the semantics of DSML-s to precisely defined and validated ``semantic units''. In our methodology, each of the syntactic and semantic DSML components is defined precisely and completely. The main contribution of our approach is that it moves toward an infrastructure for DSML design that integrates formal methods with practical engineering tools. In this paper we use a mathematical model, Abstract State Machines, a common semantic framework to define the semantic domains of DSML-s.},

  abstract = {Over the years, a number of approaches have been proposed on the description of systems and software in terms of multiple views represented by models. This modelling branch, so-called multi-view software and system modelling, praises a differentiated and complex scientific body of knowledge. With this study, we aimed at identifying, classifying, and evaluating existing solutions for multi-view modelling of software and systems. To this end, we conducted a systematic literature review of the existing state of the art related to the topic. More specifically, we selected and analysed 40 research studies among over 8600 entries. We defined a taxonomy for characterising solutions for multi-view modelling and applied it to the selected studies. Lastly, we analysed and discussed the data extracted from the studies. From the analysed data, we made several observations, among which: (i) there is no uniformity nor agreement in the terminology when it comes to multi-view artefact types, (ii) multi-view approaches have not been evaluated in industrial settings and (iii) there is a lack of support for semantic consistency management and the community does not appear to consider this as a priority. The study results provide an exhaustive overview of the state of the art for multi-view software and systems modelling useful for both researchers and practitioners.},

Metamodels can capture the former facet, while Models of Computation (MoCs) capture the latter facet. Unfortunately, theories and tools for metamodeling and MoCs have evolved independently, creating a cultural and technical chasm between the two communities. Consequently, there is currently no framework to explicitly model and compose both facets of a DSL. This paper introduces a new framework to combine a metamodel and a MoC in a modular fashion. This allows (i) the complete and executable definition of a DSL, (ii) the reuse of a given MoC for different domain-specific metamodels, and (iii) the use of different MoCs for a given metamodel, to account for variants of a DSL.},

  abstract = {Current metamodeling techniques can be used to specify the syntax and semantics of domain specific modeling languages (DSMLs). Still, there is little support for explicitly specifying concurrency semantics of DSMLs. Often, such semantics are provided by the implicit concurrency model of the execution environment supported by the language workbench used to implement the DSMLs. The lack of an explicit concurrency model has several drawbacks: it prevents from developing a complete understanding of the DSML's behavioral semantics, as well as effective concurrency-aware analysis techniques, and explicit models of semantic variants. This work reifies concurrency as a metamodeling facility, leveraging formalization work from the concurrency theory and models of computation (MoC) community. The essential contribution of this paper is a language workbench for binding domain-specific concepts and models of computation through an explicit event structure at the metamodel level. We present a case study that serves to demonstrate the utility of the novel metamodeling facilities and clarify the scope of the approach.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, the BPMN 2.0 notation is widely used both for modelling and implementing business processes. Even if it is largely adopted, the BPMN standard lacks a formal specification of models' behaviour, leading to misinterpretations of the execution semantics of some tricky modelling elements. This may result in processes that do not fit with designers' expectations and behave differently from one enactment tool to another. One of the most prominent BPMN elements with an ambiguous treatment in the BPMN standard is the OR-Join gateway. Although various attempts of OR-Join formalisation have been proposed in the literature, they either do not fully comply with the prescriptions of the current version of the BPMN standard or do not provide an efficient characterisation. To fill this gap, we propose a formalisation of the BPMN semantics including the OR-Join behaviour as reported in version 2.0 of the standard. Besides, to make it suitable for driving an efficient implementation, we provide an alternative characterisation of the formal semantics that determine the OR-Join gateway activation only based on information local to the considered OR-Join element, without the need of knowing the global tokens distribution. The soundness of the approach is given by demonstrating the correspondence of the local semantics to the global one. Through validation experiments conducted on the implementations of the local and global semantics of the OR-Join, we have shown that the local semantics more efficiently determines the gateway activation. Finally, we support designers in precisely understanding the OR-Join behaviour via a model animator tool.},

  abstract = {BPMN collaboration models have acquired increasing relevance in software development since they shorten the communication gap between domain experts and IT specialists and permit clarifying the characteristics of software systems needed to provide automatic support for the activities of complex organizations. Nonetheless, the lack of effective formal verification capabilities can hinder the full adoption of the BPMN standard by IT specialists, as it prevents precisely check the satisfaction of behavioral properties, with negative impacts on the quality of the software. To address these issues, this paper proposes BProVe, a novel verification approach for BPMN collaborations. This combines both standard model checking techniques, through the MAUDE's LTL model checker, and statistical model checking techniques, through the statistical analyzer MultiVeStA. The latter makes BProVe effective also on those scenarios suffering from the state\textendash space explosion problem, made even more acute by the presence of asynchronous message exchanges. To support the adoption of the BProVe approach, we propose a complete web-based tool-chain that allows for BPMN modeling, verification, and result exploration. The feasibility of BProVe has been validated both on synthetically-generated models and on models retrieved from two public repositories. The performed validation highlighted the importance and complementarity of the two supported verification strategies.},

  abstract = {The increasing adoption of modelling methods contributes to a better understanding of the flow of processes, from the internal behaviour of a single organisation to a wider perspective where several organisations exchange messages. In this regard, BPMN collaborations provide a suitable modelling abstraction. Even if this is a widely accepted notation, only a limited effort has been expended in formalising its semantics, especially for what it concerns the interplay among control features, data handling and exchange of messages in scenarios requiring multiple instances of interacting participants. In this paper, we face the problem of providing a formal semantics for BPMN collaborations including elements dealing with multiple instances, i.e., multi-instance pools and sequential/parallel multi-instance tasks. For an accurate account of these features, it is necessary to consider the data perspective of collaboration models, thus supporting data objects, data collections and data stores, and different execution modalities of tasks concerning atomicity and concurrency. Beyond defining a novel formalisation, we also provide a BPMN collaboration animator tool, named MIDA, faithfully implementing the formal semantics. MIDA can also support designers in debugging multi-instance collaboration models.},

  abstract = {We present a declarative and visual debugging environment for Eclipse called JIVE.1 Traditional debugging is procedural in that a programmer must proceed step-by-step and objectby-object in order to uncover the cause of an error. In contrast, we present a declarative approach to debugging consisting of a flexible set of queries over a program's execution history as well as over individual runtime states. This runtime information is depicted in a visual manner during program execution in order to aid the debugging process. The current state of execution is depicted through an enhanced object diagram, and the history of execution is depicted by a sequence diagram. Our methodology makes use of these diagrams as a means of formulating queries and reporting results in a visual manner. It also supports revisiting past runtime states, either through reverse stepping of the program or through queries that report information from past states. Eclipse serves as an ideal framework for implementing JIVE since, like the JIVE architecture, it makes crucial use of the Java Platform Debugging Architecture (JPDA). This paper presents details of the JIVE architecture and its integration into Eclipse.},

State-of-the-art merging techniques are often limited to textual artifacts (e.g., source code) and they are unable to discover and resolve complex merging issues beyond simple conflicts. This work focuses on the merging of models where we consider not only conflicts but also arbitrary syntactic and semantic consistency issues. Consistent artifacts are merged fully automatically and only inconsistent/conflicting artifacts are brought to the users' attention, together with a systematic proposal of how to resolve them. Our approach is neutral with regard to who made the changes and hence reduces the bias caused by any individual engineer's limited point of view. Our approach also applies to arbitrary design or models, provided that they follow a well-defined metamodel with explicit constraints\textemdash the norm nowadays. The extensive empirical evaluation suggests that our approach scales to practical settings.},

  abstract = {Engineering systems are becoming increasingly complex as state of the art technologies are incorporated into designs. Surety modeling and analysis is an emerging science that permits an engineer to qualitatively and quantitatively predict and assess the completeness and predictability of a design. Surety is a term often used in the Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Energy (DOE) communities, which refers to the integration of safety, security, reliability and performance aspects of design. Current risk assessment technologies for analyzing complex systems fail to adequately describe the problem, thus making assessment fragmented and non-integrated. To address this problem, we have developed a methodology and extensible software toolset to address model integration and complexity for high consequence systems. The MultiGraph Architecture (MGA) facilitates multi-domain, model-integrated modeling and analyses of complex, high-assurance systems. The MGA modeling environment allows the engineer to customize the modeling environment to match a design paradigm representative of the actual design. Previous modeling tools have a predefined model space that forces the modeler to work in less than optimal environments. Current approaches force the problem to be bounded and constrained by requirements of the modeling tool and not the actual design problem. In some small cases, this is only marginally adequate. The MGA facilitates the implementation of a surety methodology, which is used to represent high assurance systems with respect to safety and reliability. Formal mathematical models are used to correctly describe design safety and reliability functionality and behavior. The functional and behavioral representations of the design are then analyzed using commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) tools.},

Unfortunately, the current lack of support for explicitly relating concepts expressed in different DSMLs makes it very difficult for software and system engineers to reason about information spread across models describing different system aspects. As a particular challenge, we present in this paper how we dealt with relationships between heterogeneous behavioral models to support their concurrent and coordinated execution. This was achieved by providing dedicated meta-language to define the behavioral semantics of DSMLs and their coordination. The approach made explicit a formal model of the control flow (MoCC); domain-specific actions (DSA) and a well-defined protocol between them (incl., mapping, feedback and callback) reified through explicit domain-specific events (DSE). The protocol is then used to infer a relevant behavioral language interface for specifying coordination patterns to be applied on conforming executable models. As a result, heterogeneous languages and their relationships can be developed in the GEMOC studio, which provides extensive support to run and debug heterogeneous models. This is outlined in the paper on the definition of the Marked Graph language and its coordination with a scenario language.},

Logical Time provides a relaxed form of time that is functional, elastic (can be abstracted or refined) and multiform.

It provides an XText-based editor of constraints, a polychronous clock calculus engine able to process a partial order conforming to the set of constraints and it supports several simulation policies.

AToM3 uses the information found in the meta-models to automatically generate tools to process (create, edit, check, optimize, transform and generate simulators for) the models in the described formalism. Model processing is described at a meta-level by means of models in the graph grammar formalism. As an example, meta-models for both syntax and semantics of Statcharts (without hierarchy) and Petri-Nets are presented. This includes a graph grammar modelling the transformation between Statecharts and Petri-Nets.},

The mix of constructs found in BPMN makes it possible to create models with semantic errors. Such errors are especially serious, because errors in the early phases of systems development are among the most costly and hardest to correct. The ability to statically check the semantic correctness of models is thus a desirable feature for modelling tools based on BPMN. Accordingly, this paper proposes a mapping from BPMN to a formal language, namely Petri nets, for which efficient analysis techniques are available. The proposed mapping has been implemented as a tool that, in conjunction with existing Petri net-based tools, enables the static analysis of BPMN models. The formalisation also led to the identification of deficiencies in the BPMN standard specification.},

Many important synchronization scenarios are based on diagram operations of square shape. Composition of such operations amounts to their tiling, and complex synchronizers can thus be assembled by tiling together simple synchronization blocks. This gives rise to a visually suggestive yet precise notation for specifying synchronization procedures and reasoning about them.},

Besides multiarity, our lenses feature reflective updates, when consistency restoration requires some amendment of the update that violated consistency, and a reasonable PutPut law that requires compatibility of update propagation with update composition for a precisely specified restricted class of composable update pairs. We emphasize the importance of various ways of lens composition for practical applications of the framework, and prove several composition results.},

  abstract = {Researchers have been evaluating the benefits of ModelDriven Development (MDD) for more than a decade now. Although some works suggest that MDD decreases development time, other works limit MDD benefits to academic exercises and to developers without experience. To clarify the benefits of MDD, we present the results of our experiment, which compares MDD and Code-centric Development (CcD) in terms of correctness, efficiency, and satisfaction. Our experiment achieves fidelity to real-world settings because the tasks are taken from real-world video game development, and the subjects use domain frameworks as they are used in real-world developments. Our results challenge previous ideas that limit the benefits of MDD to academic exercises and to developers without experience. Furthermore, our results also suggest that understanding the benefits of MDD might require researchers to rethink their experiments to include the social part of software development.},

Formally analyzing such processes is a crucial challenge in order to avoid erroneous executions of the corresponding software. In this paper, we focus on timed business processes where execution time can be associated to several BPMN constructs. We propose an encoding of timed business processes into the Maude language, which allows one to automatically verify several properties of interest on processes such as the maximum/minimum/average execution time or the timed degree of parallelism that provides a valuable guide for the problem of resource allocation. The analysis is achieved using the rewriting-based tools available in Maude, which also provides other techniques (e.g., reachability analysis and model checking) for verifying BPMN specifications. We applied our approach on a large set of BPMN processes for evaluation purposes.},

  abstract = {To understand and manipulate a complex system, it is necessary to apply the separation of concerns and produce separate models, called viewpoints models. These models represent views on the system that correspond to distinct business domains. They are generally heterogeneous, i.e. conform to different meta-models. The management of the system's global model (a complete view of the system) requires the identification of the existing correspondences among the viewpoints models. However, in practice these correspondences are either incompletely identified or not sufficiently formalized to be maintained when models evolve. This restricts their use and does not allow their full exploitation for managing the global model. To fix this issue, we propose AHM (Alignment of Heterogeneous Models), an approach to organize the source models as a network of models through a virtual global model called M1C (Model of correspondences between models) that conforms to a Meta-Model of Correspondences (MMC). AHM proposes also a process, allowing for both the creation of the global model, and its consistency control. Partial automation of this process is done through a refining mechanism supported by a semantics expression described in a Domain Specific Language (DSL). The application of AHM is illustrated by the example of a conference management system. A prototype of a tool called Heterogeneous Matching and Consistency management Suite (HMCS) has been developed to support this approach.},

This procedure reduces the complexity and improves the reuse of the developed products. MDE (Model Driven Engineering) is a recent software engineering discipline that focuses this approach. It has allowed several significant improvements in the development of complex software systems by providing the means that enable to switch from one abstraction level into another or from one modeling space into another. However, models management may be tedious and costly. Thus, it is necessary to provide some flexible and reliable tools for automatic management of models and some techniques for their transformations in order to live up to user expectations. In this context, model composition has become an important artifact in the MDE domain that allows constructing and composing an efficient assembly process. In this paper, we present the state of the art of recent works in the model composition methods and techniques by focusing on the various parameters that govern and characterize their behavior.},

In this paper, we discuss the issue of consistency of behavioral models in the UML and present a general methodology how consistency problems can be dealt with. According to the methodology, those aspects of the models relevant to the consistency are mapped to a semantic domain in which precise consistency tests can be formulated. The choice of the semantic domain and the definition of consistency conditions can be used to construct different consistency notions. We show the applicability of our methodology by giving an example of a concrete consistency problem of concurrent object-oriented models.},

In particular, there is a lack of precise terminology for describing observations about language composition in theory and in existing language-development systems. To clarify the issue, we specify five forms of language composition: language extension, language restriction, language unification, self-extension, and extension composition. We illustrate this classification by various examples and apply it to discuss the performance of different language-development systems with respect to language composition. We hope that the terminology provided by our classification will enable more precise communication on language composition.},

Our results show that industrial business process models can be checked in a few milliseconds, which enables tight integration of modeling with controlflow analysis.

  abstract = {Software model checkers are typically language-specific, require substantial development efforts, and are hard to reuse for other languages. Adding partial order reduction (POR) capabilities to such tools typically requires sophisticated changes to the tool's model checking algorithms. This paper proposes a new method to make software model checkers language-independent and improving their performance through POR. Getting the POR capabilities does not require making any changes to the underlying model checking algorithms: for each language L, they are instead achieved through a theory transformation RL \textrightarrow{} RL+P OR of L's formal semantics, rewrite theory RL. Under very minimal assumptions, this can be done for any language L with relatively little effort. Our experiments with the JVM, a Promela-like language and Maude indicate that significant state space reductions and time speedups can be gained for tools generated this way.},

  abstract = {To cope with the challenge of managing the complexity of automated production systems, model-based approaches are applied increasingly. However, due to the multitude of different disciplines involved in automated production systems engineering, e.g., mechanical, electrical, and software engineering, several modeling languages are used within a project to describe the system from different perspectives. To ensure that the resulting system models are not contradictory, the necessity to continuously diagnose and handle inconsistencies within and in between models arises. This article proposes a comprehensive approach that allows stakeholders to specify, diagnose, and handle inconsistencies in model-based systems engineering. In particular, to explicitly capture the dependencies and consistency rules that must hold between the disparate engineering models, a dedicated graphical modeling language is proposed. By means of this language, stakeholders can specify, diagnose, and handle inconsistencies in the accompanying inconsistency management framework. The approach is implemented based on the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) and evaluated based on a demonstrator project as well as a small user experiment. First findings indicate that the approach is expressive enough to capture typical dependencies and consistency rules in the automated production system domain and that it requires less effort compared to manually developing inter-model inconsistency management solutions.},

  abstract = {Our research project aims at enabling multi-simulation based on the FMI 2.0 standard and the cooperation of multiple FMUs (FMI simulation units). In order to support large scale multi-simulations, our solution (DACCOSIM) runs on multicore and distributed architectures. To support variable step size, the necessary error control and rollbacks are achieved through a hierarchical and distributed control architecture. At each step, simulation data communications also occur, but directly between FMU pairs in a fully decentralized fashion. Moreover, DACCOSIM implements an algorithm to perform the complex initialization of the various components of the multi-simulation. DACCOSIM comes as a graphical framework to easily design a multi-simulation and to automatically generate associated code, and as a multithreaded and distributed library to execute it. We evaluated DACCOSIM on an industrial use case provided by EDF (leading French utility company), run on multi-core PCs and PC clusters. Preliminary performance measurements on a 4-physical-core PC exhibit a speedup compared to monothreaded Dymola execution using the same FMUs. On multi-core PC clusters we face overhead communication times due to frequent small communications but this distribution allows to process large cosimulations.},

  abstract = {Modeling and simulation techniques are today extensively used both in industry and science. Parts of larger systems are, however, typically modeled and simulated by different techniques, tools, and algorithms. In addition, experts from different disciplines use various modeling and simulation techniques. Both these facts make it difficult to study coupled heterogeneous systems.             Co-simulation is an emerging enabling technique, where global simulation of a coupled system can be achieved by composing the simulations of its parts. Due to its potential and interdisciplinary nature, co-simulation is being studied in different disciplines but with limited sharing of findings.             In this survey, we study and survey the state-of-the-art techniques for co-simulation, with the goal of enhancing future research and highlighting the main challenges.             To study this broad topic, we start by focusing on discrete-event-based co-simulation, followed by continuous-time-based co-simulation. Finally, we explore the interactions between these two paradigms, in hybrid co-simulation.             To survey the current techniques, tools, and research challenges, we systematically classify recently published research literature on co-simulation, and summarize it into a taxonomy. As a result, we identify the need for finding generic approaches for modular, stable, and accurate coupling of simulation units, as well as expressing the adaptations required to ensure that the coupling is correct.},

In particular, we identify a small set of criteria (that have already been somehow presented in the literature) that an encoding should satisfy to be considered a valid means for language comparison. We argue that the combination of such criteria is a valid proposal by noting that: (i) several well-known encodings appeared in the literature satisfy them; (ii) this notion is not trivial, because some known encodings do not satisfy all the criteria we have proposed; (iii) several well-known separation results can be formulated in terms of our criteria; and (iv) some widely believed (but never formally proved) separation results can be proved by using the criteria we propose. Moreover, the criteria defined induce general proof-techniques for separation results that can be easily instantiated to cover known case-studies.},

  abstract = {In Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) model transformation languages are used to describe important operations on models. Such domain-specific languages are specially developed to describe transformation rules, according to which an output model should be generated from an input model. In comparison to these domain-specific languages, techniques to analyze and improve the performance of programs written in a general-purpose language, such as Java or C, are well known. However, are such techniques also needed for model transformation languages? Problem. Since these languages are only used in certain domains; the first question is whether performance is at all relevant for model transformations and whether techniques similar to those used to analyze and improve the performance of general-purpose languages are needed. Research in the performance of model transformations focuses mainly on comparing the performance of different languages or different definition styles or optimizing the engine that executes the transformation. However, it is not clear to what extent these efforts can mitigate or prevent performance issues, and there is also a lack of studies that examine to what extend the performance of transformations is relevant. Method. In order to close this gap and to answer the initial question about the relevance of performance, we conducted an online survey. For this purpose, we developed a questionnaire and identified 649 authors as potential participants based on a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on a selection of model transformation languages. Additionally, we were able to acquire four further potential participants by advertising our study. In total, 84 participants took part in our survey. We used statistical tests such as Kendall's {$\tau$}c, the Kruskal-Wallis-Test and the Mann-Whitney-U-Test to evaluate our hypotheses on relevant factors for the performance of model transformations. Results. The results show that specific performance is desired and that there is a willingness to improve performance. In this regard, we identified a need for insights necessary to better understand how a transformation is performed in order to be able to improve its performance. Furthermore, we investigated with the help of hypotheses tests the possible influencing factors that cause participants to try to analyze or improve the performance of model transformations. The main results of the hypotheses tests are that the satisfaction with the execution time, the size of the models used, the relevance of whether a specific execution time is not exceeded in the average case, and the knowledge of how a transformation engine executes a transformation are relevant factors.},

It differs from conventional debuggers in that it is machine-independent, graphical, programmable, distributed, extensible, and small. Low-level operations are performed by communicating with a "nub," which is a small set of machine-dependent functions that are embedded in the target program at compile-time, or are implemented on top of existing debuggers. deet has a set of commands that communicate with the target's nub. The target and deet communicate by passing messages through a pipe or socket, so they can be on a different machines. deet is implemented in tksh, an extension of the Korn shell that provides the graphical facilities of Tcl/Tk. Users can browse source files, set breakpoints, watch variables, and examine data structures by pointing and clicking. Additional facilities, like conditional breakpoints, can be written in either Tcl or the shell. Most debuggers are large and complicated, deet is less than 1,500 lines of shell plus a few hundred lines of machine-specific nub code. It is thus easy to understand, modify, and extend. We describe an implementation of the nub API for Java and an implementation that is layered on top of gdb. We have also implemented a version of gdb using the nub API, which demonstrates the modularity of the design.},

The details of this play-in methodology and the play-engine tool we have built to support it are given in [10]. The same paper also describes playout, a complementary idea to play-in, which, rather surprisingly, makes it possible to execute the requirements directly without having to build or synthesize an intra-object model of the system. In [11], smart play-out is introduced, which strengthens the `naive' play-out algorithms by using analytic techniques from the field of formal verification, mainly model checking.},

However, the practical adoption of code generation remains relatively slow and limited to niche applications. Tooling issues are often pointed out but more fundamentally, experience shows that: (i) models and modeling languages used for other purposes are not necessarily well suited for code generation and (ii) code generators are often seen as black-boxes which are not easy to trust and produce sub-optimal code. This paper presents and discusses our experiences applying the ThingML approach to different domains. ThingML includes a modeling language and tool designed for supporting code generation and a highly customizable multi-platform code generation framework. The approach is implemented in an open-source tool providing a family of code generators targeting heterogeneous platforms. It has been evaluated through several case studies and is being used for in the development of a commercial ambient assisted living system.},

This phenomenon is what Baez and Dolan have called the microcosm principle, a prototypical example of which is ``a monoid in a monoidal category.'' In this paper we obtain a formalization of the microcosm principle in which such a nested model is expressed categorically as a suitable lax natural transformation. An application of this account is a general compositionality result which supports modular verification of complex systems.},

  abstract = {Objective: The goal of this work is to synthesize available research results to inform evidence-based selection of actionable alert identification techniques (AAIT). Method: Relevant studies about AAITs were gathered via a systematic literature review. Results: We selected 21 peer-reviewed studies of AAITs. The techniques use alert type selection; contextual information; data fusion; graph theory; machine learning; mathematical and statistical models; or dynamic detection to classify and prioritize actionable alerts. All of the AAITs are evaluated via an example with a variety of evaluation metrics. Conclusion: The selected studies support (with varying strength), the premise that the effective use of ASA is improved by supplementing ASA with an AAIT. Seven of the 21 selected studies reported the precision of the proposed AAITs. The two studies with the highest precision built models using the subject program's history. Precision measures how well a technique identifies true actionable alerts out of all predicted actionable alerts. Precision does not measure the number of actionable alerts missed by an AAIT or how well an AAIT identifies unactionable alerts. Inconsistent use of evaluation metrics, subject programs, and ASAs in the selected studies preclude meta-analysis and prevent the current results from informing evidence-based selection of an AAIT. We propose building on an actionable alert identification benchmark for comparison and evaluation of AAIT from literature on a standard set of subjects and utilizing a common set of evaluation metrics.},

There has been a great effort in providing a formal semantics for BPMN, and then in building verification tools on top of this semantics. However, communication aspects are often discarded in the literature. This is an issue since BPMN has gained interest outside its original scope, e.g., for the IoT, where the configuration of communication modes plays an important role. In this paper, we propose a formal semantics for a subset of BPMN, taking into account inter-process communication and parametric verification with reference to communication modes. As opposed to transformational approaches, that map BPMN into some formal model such as transition systems or Petri nets, we give a direct formalization in First-Order Logic that is then implemented in TLA\$\$\^+\$\$to enable formal verification. Our approach is tool supported. The tool, as well as the TLA\$\$\^+\$\$theories, and experiment models are available online.},

  abstract = {The BPMN standard notation allows business process designers to model both intra-organizational processes and inter-organizational collaborations. A great effort has been devoted in proposing formal semantics for BPMN, and, fewer, in providing dedicated verification tools. Still, some advanced features of BPMN, namely communication or time-related constructs, are often set aside. This becomes an issue as BPMN gains interest outside of its original scope, e.g., for the IoT where communication and time play an important role. In this paper, we propose a formal semantics for a subset of BPMN. This semantics takes into account not only the usual gateways, but also sub-processes, inter-process communication, and time-related constructs. In contrast to transformational approaches, which give a semantics to BPMN by mapping it to some formal model (e.g., transition systems or Petri nets), our approach is based on a direct formalization in first-order logic that is then realized in a straightforward way into the TLA+ formal language. We build on the TLA+ model-checker, TLC, to provide process designers with a verification framework, fbpmn, that one may use to check BPMN and workflow specific properties. Our tools and our model database are open source and freely available online.},

They can be simulated and debugged by existing Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) tools leading to a better understanding of the system before its implementation. However, as the quality of the resulting system is closely related to the quality of the DSL, there is a need to ensure the correctness of the DSL and apply execution engines with a high level of trust. To this aim we developed Meeduse, a tool in which the MDE paradigm is mixed with a formal method assisted by automated reasoning tools such as provers and model-checkers. Meeduse assists the formal definition of the DSL static semantics by translating its meta-model into an equivalent formal B specification. The dynamic semantics can be defined using proved B operations that guarantee the correctness of the DSL's behavior with respect to its safety invariant properties. Regarding execution, Meeduse applies the ProB animator in order to animate underlying domain-specific scenarios.},

  abstract = {The context of this work is a practical, open-source visualization system, called JIVE, that supports two forms of runtime visualizations of Java programs \textendash{} object diagrams and sequence diagrams. They capture, respectively, the current execution state and execution history of a Java program. These diagrams are similar to those found in the UML for specifying design\textendash time decisions. In our work, we construct these diagrams at execution time, thereby ensuring continuity of notation from design to execution. In so doing, a few extensions to the UML notation are proposed in order to better represent runtime behavior. As sequence diagrams can become long and unwieldy, we present techniques for their compact representation. A key result in this paper is a novel labeling scheme based upon regular expressions to compactly represent long sequences and an O r2 algorithm for computing these labels, where r is the length of the input sequence, based upon the concept of `tandem repeats' in a sequence. Horizontal compaction greatly helps minimize the extent of white space in sequence diagrams by the elimination of object lifelines and also by grouping lifelines together. We propose a novel extension to the sequence diagram to deal with out-of-model calls when the lifelines of certain classes of objects are filtered out of the visualization, but method calls may occur between in-model and out-of-model calls. The paper also presents compaction techniques for multithreaded Java execution with different forms of synchronization. Finally, we present experimental results from compacting the runtime visualizations of a variety of Java programs and execution trace sizes in order to demonstrate the practicality and efficacy of our techniques.

  abstract = {Finite-state models are extensively used for discrete systems and they have also been adopted for the analysis and verification of concurrent systems. Programs that have a repetitive cycle, such as event-driven servers and controllers, lend themselves to finite-state modeling. In this article, we use the term model extraction to refer to the construction of a finite-state model from an execution trace of a Java program and a set of key attributes, that is, a subset of the fields of the objects in the program execution. By choosing different sets of attributes, different finite-state models (or views) of the execution can be obtained. Such models aid program comprehension and they can also be used in debugging a program. We present algorithms for model extraction and also for model abstraction in order to reduce the size of the extracted models so that they are amenable to visualization. For long executions, we show how to minimize the overhead of execution trace collection through a bytecode instrumentation technique; and, for large models, which are not amenable to visualization, we show how key properties of the extracted model can be checked against declarative specifications. We have implemented our techniques in the context of JIVE, an Eclipse plugin that supports runtime visualization and analysis of Java program executions. We illustrate our techniques through a collection of case studies of varying size and complexity, from classic problems of concurrency control to a medium-size protocol for authorization (OAuth2.0 protocol) to a large-scale software that underlies web applications (Apache Tomcat server).},

  abstract = {The automated synthesis of behavioural models in the form of state machines (SMs) from higher-level specifications has a high potential impact on the efficiency and accuracy of software development using models. In this paper, inspired by program synthesis techniques, we propose a model synthesis approach that takes as input a structural model of a system and its desired system properties, and automatically synthesizes executable SMs for its components. To this end, we first generate a synthesis formula for each component, consistent with the system properties, and then perform a State Space Exploration (SSE) of each component, based on its synthesis formula. The result of the SSE is saved in a Labeled Transition System (LTS), for which we then synthesize detailed actions for each of its transitions. Finally, we transform the LTSs into UML-RT (UML real-time profile) SMs, and integrate them with the original structural models. We assess the applicability, performance, and scalability of our approach using several different use cases extracted from the literature.},

In this paper, we propose an approach for transforming UML statechart and collaboration diagrams to Colored Petri net models. This transformation aims to bridge the gap between informal notation (UML diagrams) and more formal notation (Colored Petri net models) for analysis purposes. It produces highlystructured, graphical, and rigorously-analyzable models that facilitate early detection of errors such as deadlock and livelock. The approach is based on graph transformations where the input and output of the transformation process are graphs. The meta-modeling tool AToM3 is used. A case study is presented to illustrate our approach.},

Aspectoriented modeling techniques have been proposed to address the scalability problem within individual modeling notations. This paper presents RAM, an aspect-oriented modeling approach that provides scalable multi-view modeling. RAM allows the modeler to define stand-alone reusable aspect models using 3 modeling notations. The aspect models support the modeling of structure (using UML class diagrams) and behavior (using UML state and sequence diagrams). RAM supports aspect dependency chains, which allows an aspect providing complex functionality to reuse the functionality provided by other aspects. The RAM weaver can create woven views of the composed model for debugging, simulation or code generation purpose, as well as perform consistency checks during the weaving and on the woven model to detect inconsistencies of the composition.},

  abstract = {The growing use of models for separating concerns in complex systems has lead to a proliferation of model composition operators. These composition operators have traditionally been defined from scratch following various approaches differing in formality, level of detail, chosen paradigm, and styles. Due to the lack of proper foundations for defining model composition (concepts, abstractions, or frameworks), it is difficult to compare or reuse composition operators. In this paper, we stipulate the existence of a unifying framework that reduces all structural composition operators to structural merging, and all composition operators acting on discrete behaviors to event scheduling. We provide convincing evidence of this hypothesis by discussing how structural and behavioral homogeneous model composition operators (i.e., weavers) can be mapped onto this framework. Based on this discussion, we propose a conceptual model of the framework and identify a set of research challenges, which, if addressed, lead to the realization of this framework to support rigorous and efficient engineering of model composition operators for homogeneous and eventually heterogeneous modeling languages.},

Aims: This study assesses the impact of systematic literature reviews (SLRs) which are the recommended EBSE method for aggregating evidence. Method: We used the standard systematic literature review method employing a manual search of 10 journals and 4 conference proceedings. Results: Of 20 relevant studies, eight addressed research trends rather than technique evaluation. Seven SLRs addressed cost estimation. The quality of SLRs was fair with only three scoring less than 2 out of 4. Conclusions: Currently, the topic areas covered by SLRs are limited. European researchers, particularly those at the Simula Laboratory appear to be the leading exponents of systematic literature reviews. The series of cost estimation SLRs demonstrate the potential value of EBSE for synthesising evidence and making it available to practitioners.},

  abstract = {Models are used to describe different properties of a software system. Those models often share information that is represented redundantly and, thus, has to be kept consistent. Defining model transformations between the involved metamodels is a common means to preserve the consistency of their instances. Such transformations specify the relations between instances of metamodels and how to enforce them. However, redundancies are often caused by different models containing representations of the same concept. We propose to make such common, duplicated concepts explicit instead of encoding them in transformations implicitly. We achieve this by defining an additional concept metamodel and the relations between it and the existing metamodels, which we call the Commonalities approach. We describe a language that allows to define both a concept metamodel and its relations to existing metamodels in one place, in order to achieve conciseness comparable to a direct transformation between the metamodels. Additionally, our approach allows hierarchical composition of concept metamodels to keep multiple models consistent. The expected benefits of our approach are an improved understandability of relations between metamodels by making the information about commonalities explicit, reduced errors in comparison to the combination of several transformations to keep multiple models consistent, and improved reusability because metamodels are not related directly, but only through concept metamodels.},

  abstract = {The Unified Modeling Language (UML) has been widely accepted as a standard for modeling software systems from various perspectives. The intuitive notations of UML diagrams greatly improve the communication among developers. However, the lack of a formal semantics makes it difficult to automate analysis and verification. This paper offers a graphical yet formal approach to specifying the behavioral semantics of statechart diagrams using graph transformation techniques. It supports many advanced features of statecharts, such as composite states, firing priority, history, junction, and choice. In our approach, a graph grammar is derived automatically from a state machine to summarize the hierarchy of states. Based on the graph grammar, the execution of a set of non-conflict state transitions is interpreted by a sequence of graph transformations. This facilitates verifying a design model against system requirements. To demonstrate our approach, we present a case study on a toll-gate system.},

  abstract = {The elegance of the single-pushout (SPO) approach to graph transformations arises from substituting total morphisms by partial ones in the underlying category. Thus, SPO's applicability depends on the durability of pushouts after this transition. There is a wide range of work on the question when pushouts exist in categories with partial morphisms starting with the pioneering work of L\"owe and Kennaway and ending with an essential characterisation in terms of an exactness property (for the interplay between pullbacks and pushouts) and an adjointness condition (w.r.t. inverse image functions) by Hayman and Heindel.Triple graphs and graph diagrams are frameworks to synchronize two or more updatable data sources by means of internal mappings, which identify common sub-structures. Comprehensive systems generalise these frameworks, treating the network of data sources and their structural inter-relations as a homogeneous comprehensive artifact, in which partial maps identify commonalities. Although this inherent partiality produces amplified complexity, Heindel's characterisation still yields cocompleteness of the category of comprehensive systems equipped with closed partial morphisms and thus enables computing by SPO graph transformation.},

  abstract = {Domain specific languages (DSLs) are increasingly used today. Coping with complex language definitions, evolving them in a structured way, and ensuring their error freeness are the main challenges of DSL design and implementation. The use of modular language definitions and composition operators are therefore inevitable in the independent development of language components. In this article, we discuss these arising issues by describing a framework for the compositional development of textual DSLs and their supporting tools. We use a redundance-free definition of a readable concrete syntax and a comprehensible abstract syntax as both representations significantly overlap in their structure. For enhancing the usability of the abstract syntax, we added concepts like associations and inheritance to a grammarbased definition in order to build up arbitrary graphs (as known from metamodeling). Two modularity concepts, grammar inheritance and embedding, are discussed. They permit compositional language definition and thus simplify the extension of languages based on already existing ones. We demonstrate that compositional engineering of new languages is a useful concept when project-individual DSLs with appropriate tool support are defined.},

In object technology explicit encapsulation, interfaces, and inheritance are well-known principles for independent development that enable combination and reuse of developed artifacts. In this paper we apply modularity concepts for domain specific languages (DSLs) and discuss how they help to design new languages by extending existing ones and composing fragments to new DSLs. We use an extended grammar format with appropriate tool support that avoids redefinition of existing functionalities by introducing language inheritance and embedding as first class artifacts in a DSL definition. Language embedding and inheritance is not only assisted by the parser, but also by the editor, and algorithms based on tree traversal like context checkers, pretty printers, and code generators. We demonstrate that compositional engineering of new languages becomes a useful concept when starting to define project-individual DSLs using appropriate tool support.},

Here, we show that at highly reduced surfaces a partial photo oxidation of 2-propanol is not only possible in the presence of oxygen but also in coadsorption with water or even without coadsorbates below room temperature. Thermally, only the conversion towards propane and propene was observed at temperatures above 550 K. Liquid Phase experiments further showed that the coadsorbate influences the acetone yield of the partial photo oxidation. While in the presence of oxygen an increasing acetone conversion was observed, the acetone yield is reduced in the presence of water in accordance with the hypothesis of an active site blocking by water.},

Even though these notions have been in widespread use for quite a while, there is still little consensus about when exactly it is appropriate to use them. The aim of this article is to start establishing a consensus about generally acceptable terminology. Its main contributions are the distinction between two fundamentally different kinds of model roles, i.e. ``token model'' versus ``type model'' (The terms ``type'' and ``token'' have been introduced by C.S. Peirce, 1839\textendash 1914.), a formal notion of ``metaness'', and the consideration of ``generalization'' as yet another basic relationship between models. In particular, the recognition of the fundamental difference between the above mentioned two kinds of model roles is crucial in order to enable communication among the model driven engineering community that is free of both unnoticed misunderstandings and unnecessary disagreement.},

They have a formal static semantics but their execution semantics is described only informally. Graph transformation, on the other hand, constitutes a well-studied area with many theoretical results and practical application domains. In this paper, an operational semantics for a subset of UML state machines is proposed which is based on graph transformation. In more detail, a UML state machine is described as a structured graph transformation system in such a way that the wellformedness rules of UML state machines are satisfied and the firing of a (maximum) set of enabled non-conflicting transitions corresponds to the application of a graph transformation rule. The presented approach uses the concept of transformation units, a recently developed modularization concept for graph transformation systems.},

  abstract = {The Unified Modeling Language (UML) favors the construction of models composed of several submodels, modeling the system components under development at different levels of abstraction and from different viewpoints. Currently, consistency of object-oriented models expressed in the UML is not defined in the UML language specification. This allows the construction of inconsistent UML models. Defining consistency of UML models is complicated by the fact that UML models are applied differently, depending on the application domain and development process. As a consequence, a form of consistency management is required that allows the software engineer to define, establish and manage consistency, tailored specifically to the development context. In recent years, we have developed a general methodology and tool support to overcome this problem. The methodology is based on a thorough study of the notion of consistency and has led to a generic definition of the notion of consistency. Our methodology itself aims at a step-wise systematic construction of a consistency management process, by providing a number of activities to be performed by the software engineer. It is complemented by a tool called Consistency Workbench which supports the software engineer in performing the methodology. In this paper, we provide an overview and summary of our approach.},

  abstract = {Complex systems demand diversity in the modeling mechanisms. One way to deal with a diversity of requirements is to create flexible modeling frameworks that can be adapted to cover the field of interest. The downside of this approach is a weakening of the semantics of the modeling frameworks that compromises interoperability, understandability, and analyzability of the models. An alternative approach is to embrace heterogeneity and to provide mechanisms for a diversity of models to interact. This paper reviews an approach that achieves such interaction between diverse models using an abstract semantics, which is a deliberately incomplete semantics that cannot by itself define a useful modeling framework. It instead focuses on the interactions between diverse models, reducing the nature of those interactions to a minimum that achieves a well-defined composition. An example of such an abstract semantics is the actor semantics, which can handle many heterogeneous models that are built today, and some that are not common today. The actor abstract semantics and many concrete semantics have been implemented in Ptolemy II, an open-source software framework distributed under a BSD-style license.},

Addressing these problems has many benefits to increase system developer efficiency, reliability, performance, as well as code maintenance. In this paper, we present a real-world case study of an architectural refactoring project within an industrial setting. The system in scope is our codenamed ItemIndexer delivery system (I2DS), which is responsible for processing and delivering a large number of items at rapid speed to billions of users in real time. I2DS is running in production, refactored live over a period of 9 months, and assessed through impact validation studies that show a 42\% improvement in developer efficiency, 87\% improvement in reliability, 20\% increase in item scoring, a 10\% increase in item matching, and 14\% CPU savings.},

While an execution is mostly driven by the model content (e.g., control structures), many use cases require interacting with the running model, such as simulating scenarios in an automated or interactive way, or coupling the model with other models of the system or environment. The management of these interactions is usually hardcoded into the semantics of the DSL, which prevents its reuse for other DSLs and the provision of generic interaction-centric tools (e.g., event injector). In this paper, we propose a metalanguage for complementing the definition of executable DSLs with explicit behavioral interfaces to enable external tools to interact with executed models in a unified way. We implemented the proposed metalanguage in the GEMOC Studio and show how behavioral interfaces enable the realization of tools that are generic and thus usable for different executable DSLs.},

While runtime monitoring for general purpose programming languages has seen a great amount of research, developing such complex facilities for any executable Domain Specific Language (DSL) remains a challenging, reoccurring and error prone task. A generic solution must both support a wide range of executable DSLs (xDSLs) and induce as little execution time overhead as possible. Our contribution is a fully generic approach based on a temporal property language with a semantics tailored for runtime verification. Properties can be compiled to efficient runtime monitors that can be attached to any kind of executable discrete event model within an integrated development environment. Efficiency is bolstered using a novel combination of structural model queries and complex event processing. Our evaluation on 3 xDSLs shows that the approach is applicable with an execution time overhead of 121\% (on executions shorter than 1s), to 79\% (on executions shorter than 20s) making it suitable for model testing and debugging.},

There has been initial research toward model differentiation applied to UML diagrams, but differentiation of domain-specific models has not been explored deeply in the modeling community. Traditional modeling practice using the UML relies on a single fixed generalpurpose language (i.e., all UML diagrams conform to a single metamodel). In contrast, DomainSpecific Modeling (DSM) is an emerging model-driven paradigm in which multiple metamodels are used to define various modeling languages that represent the key concepts and abstractions for particular domains. Therefore, domain-specific models may conform to various metamodels, which requires model differentiation algorithms be metamodel-independent and able to apply to multiple domain-specific modeling languages. This paper presents metamodel-independent algorithms and associated tools for detecting mappings and differences between domain-specific models, with facilities for graphical visualization of the detected differences.},

  abstract = {Actors have become widespread in programming languages and programming frameworks focused on parallel and distributed computing. While actors provide a more disciplined model for concurrency than threads, their interactions, if not constrained, admit nondeterminism. As a consequence, actor programs may exhibit unintended behaviors and are less amenable to rigorous testing. The same problem exists in other dominant concurrency models, such as threads, shared-memory models, publish-subscribe systems, and service-oriented architectures. We propose ``reactors,'' a new model of concurrent computation that combines synchronous-reactive principles with a sophisticated model of time to enable determinism while preserving much of the style and performance of actors. Reactors promote modularity and allow for distributed execution. The relationship that reactors establish between events across timelines allows for: 1. the construction of programs that react predictably to unpredictable external events; 2. the formulation of deadlines that grant control over timing; and 3. the preservation of a deterministic distributed execution semantics under quantifiable assumptions. We bring the deterministic concurrency and time-based semantics of reactors to the world of mainstream programming languages through Lingua Franca (LF), a polyglot coordination language with support (so far) for C, C++, Python, and TypeScript. In LF, program logic is given in one or more of those target languages, enabling developers to use familiar languages and integrate extensive libraries and legacy code. The main contributions of this work consist of a formalization of reactors, the implementation of an efficient runtime system for the execution of reactors, and the design and implementation of LF.},

To do this, a total of 907 papers related to UML model consistency published in literature and extracted from the most relevant scientific sources (IEEE Computer Society, ACM Digital Library, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, and the SCOPUS Database) were considered, of which 42 papers were eventually analyzed. This systematic literature review resulted in the identification of the current state-of-the-art with regard to UML model consistency management research along with open issues, trends and future research within this scope. A formal approach for the handling of inconsistency problems which fulfils the identified limitations is also briefly presented.},

  abstract = {Ageing is a degenerative process that leads to tissue dysfunction and death. A proposed cause of ageing is the accumulation of epigenetic noise that disrupts gene expression patterns, leading to decreases in tissue function and regenerative capacity1\textendash 3. Changes to DNA methylation patterns over time form the basis of ageing clocks4, but whether older individuals retain the\&nbsp;information needed\&nbsp;to restore these patterns\textemdash and, if so, whether this could improve tissue function\textemdash is not known. Over time, the central nervous system (CNS) loses function and regenerative capacity5\textendash 7. Using the eye as a model CNS tissue, here we show that ectopic expression of Oct4 (also known as Pou5f1), Sox2 and Klf4 genes (OSK) in mouse retinal ganglion cells restores youthful DNA methylation patterns and transcriptomes, promotes axon regeneration after injury, and reverses vision loss in a mouse model of glaucoma and in aged mice. The beneficial effects of OSK-induced reprogramming in axon regeneration and vision require the DNA demethylases TET1 and TET2. These data indicate that mammalian tissues retain a record of youthful epigenetic information\textemdash encoded in part by DNA methylation\textemdash that can be accessed to improve tissue function and promote regeneration in vivo. Expression of three Yamanaka transcription factors in mouse retinal ganglion cells restores youthful DNA methylation patterns, promotes axon regeneration after injury, and reverses vision loss in a mouse model of glaucoma and in aged mice, suggesting that mammalian tissues retain a record of youthful epigenetic information that can be accessed to improve tissue function.},

  abstract = {Non-trivial bidirectional transformations (BXs) are inherently ambiguous, as there are in general many different ways to consistently translate an update from one side to the other. Existing BX languages and frameworks typically satisfy fundamental first principles which ensure acceptable and stable (well-behaved) translation. Unfortunately, these give little insight about how a particular update translation is chosen among the myriad possible. From the user perspective, such unpredictability may hinder the adoption of BX frameworks.    The problem can be remedied by imposing a ``principle of least change'' which, in a state-based framework, amounts to translating each update in a way such that its result is as close as possible to the original state, according to some distance measure.    Starting by formalizing such BXs focusing on the particular framework of lenses, this paper discusses whether such least-change lenses can be defined by composition, an essential construct of BX frameworks. For sequential composition, two (dual) update translation alternatives are presented: a classical deterministic one and a nondeterministic. A key ingredient of the approach is the elegant formalization of the main concepts in relation algebra, which exposes several similarities and dualities.},

Graph transformation \textendash{} the rule-based modification of graphs \textendash{} is also an important approach used in many contexts, as for instance, the definition of syntax and semantics of visual languages and the modelling and analysis of concurrent and non-deterministic systems. Although the algebraic double-pushout (DPO) approach to graph transformation has a vast theory, it does not present a notion of higher-order transformation, i.e., transformation of graph rewriting rules themselves. Higher-order would be required, for instance, to ease the modelling of dynamic systems through graph transformation systems, and to describe model transformations that modify graph rewriting rules. The main contribution of this work is a notion of double-pushout transformation for graph rewriting rules, where the result of the rewriting is a valid graph rule. We use DPO diagrams in the category of graph spans to describe rule transformations, and negative application conditions (NACs) in the second-order rules to enforce preservation of the rule structure. We define a model named second-order graph grammars, capable of first- and secondorder derivations. Finally, we discuss alternative ways of defining second-order transformations.},

Real problems must be properly conceptualized and represented, appropriate techniques for their solution must be constructed, and solutions must be implemented and evaluated using appropriate criteria. If significant progress is to be made, IT research must also develop an understanding of how and why IT systems work or do not work. Such an understanding must tie together natural laws governing IT systems with natural laws governing the environments in which they operate. This paper presents a two dimensional framework for research in information technology. The first dimension is based on broad types of design and natural science research activities: build, evaluate, theorize, and justify. The second dimension is based on broad types of outputs produced by design research: representational constructs, models, methods, and instantiations. We argue that both design science and natural science activities are needed to insure that IT research is both relevant and effective.},

An important metric when developing a business process is its degree of parallelism, i.e., the maximum number of tasks that are executable in parallel in that process. The degree of parallelism determines the peak demand on tasks, providing a valuable guide for the problem of resource allocation in business processes. In this paper, we investigate how to automatically measure the degree of parallelism for business processes, described using the BPMN standard notation. We first present a formal model for BPMN processes in terms of Labelled Transition Systems, which are obtained through process algebra encodings. We then propose an approach for automatically computing the degree of parallelism by using model checking techniques and dichotomic search. We implemented a tool for automating this check and we applied it successfully to more than one hundred BPMN processes.},

System level design languages (SLDL)s that facilitate multi-MoC modeling should have well-defined semantics and should be readily subjected to formal analysis to handle the design complexity. As a result, we follow the multi-MoC paradigm based on timing abstraction and functional parameterizations that have rigorous denotational semantics, which are compliant to functional idioms as shown in functional frameworks such as ForSyDe and SML-Sys. However functional frameworks are not widely used in the industry due to issues related to efficiency and interoperability with other widely used SLDLs. This necessitates an imperative language based implementation of these generic MoCs that offers all the advantages of the underlying formal semantics. In this paper, we formulate the basis for having generic MoCs in an imperative language and describe the implementation of an untimed modeling framework called UMoC++.},

Consequently, nowadays we can find a large variety of DSLs for diverse purposes. However, not all these DSLs are completely different; many of them share certain commonalities coming from similar modeling patterns \textendash{} such as state machines or petri nets \textendash{} used for several purposes. In this scenario, the challenge for language designers is to take advantage of the commonalities existing among similar DSLs by reusing, as much as possible, formerly defined language constructs. The objective is to leverage previous engineering efforts to minimize implementation from scratch. To this end, recent research in software language engineering proposes the use of product line engineering, thus introducing the notion of language product lines. Nowadays, there are several approaches that result useful in the construction of language product lines. In this article, we report on an effort for organizing the literature on language product line engineering. More precisely, we propose a definition for the life-cycle of language product lines, and we use it to analyze the capabilities of current approaches. In addition, we provide a mapping between each approach and the technological space it supports.},

Scenario languages were introduced into the Uni ed Modeling Language (UML) under the name of Sequence Diagrams. The 2.0 version of UML changed Sequence Diagrams signi cantly and the expressiveness of the language was highly increased. However, the complexity of the language (and the diversity of the goals Sequence Diagrams are used for) yields several possible choices in its semantics. This paper collects and categorizes the semantic choices in the language, surveys the formal semantics proposed for Sequence Diagrams, and presents how these approaches handle the various semantic choices.},

  abstract = {Model-driven engineering, an emerging trend in software engineering, has enabled the use of refactoring to UML models. Numerous approaches to model refactoring, problem detection, consistency management, and tool support to automate and verify refactoring are discussed and distributed across numerous research literatures. This paper provides a systematic overview of existing research in the field of model refactoring. A total of 3,295 articles, related to the field of UML model refactoring, were extracted from wellknown electronic databases. A multi-stage selection process was used to ensure proper inclusion of relevant studies for review and analysis. Ninety-four primary studies were eventually selected and analyzed based on a number of different criteria: UML models considered for refactoring, formalisms used to support refactoring at the model level, important to consider when building refactoring tool support, and the effect of refactoring on model quality. The results of this review indicate that UML model refactoring is a highly active area of research. Quite a few quality techniques and approaches have been proposed in this area, but it still has some important open issues and limitations to be addressed in future work.},

  abstract = {Much of the recent research in software visualization has been polarized toward two opposite domains. In one domain that we call               data structure and program visualization               , low-level canonical views of program structures are generated automatically. These types of views, which do not require programmer input or intervention, can be useful for testing and debugging software. Often, however, their generic, low-level views are not expressive enough to convey adequately how a program functions. In the second domain called               algorithm animation               , designers handcraft abstract, application-specific views that are useful for program understanding and teaching. Unfortunately, since algorithm animation development typically requires time-consuming design with a   graphics package, it will not be used for debugging, where timeliness is a necessity. However, we speculate that the application-specific nature of algorithm animation views could be a valuable debugging aid for software developers as well, if only the views could be easy and rapid to create. We have developed a system called               Lens               that occupies a unique niche between the two domains discussed above and explores the capabilities that such a system may offer. Lens allows programmers to build rapidly (in minutes) algorithm animation-style program views without requiring any sophisticated graphics knowledge and without using textual coding. Lens also is integrated with a system debugger to promote iterative design and exploration.},

  abstract = {In this work, we alleviate the well-known State-Space Explosion (SSE) problem in Component Based Systems (CBS). We consider CBS that can be specified as a system of n Communicating Finite State Machines (CFSMs) interacting by rendezvous/handshake method. In order to avoid the SSE incurred by the traditional product machine composition of the given input CFSMs based on interleaving semantics, weconstructa sum machine composition based on state-oriented partial-order semantics. The sum machine consists of a set of n unfolded CFSMs. By storing statically, just a small subset of global state vectors at synchronizationpoints, called the synchronousenvironment vectors and generating the rest of the global-state vectors dynamically on need basis depending on the reachability to be verified, the sum machine alleviates the SSE of the product machine. We demonstrate the implementation of checking the reachability of global state vector from the checking of local reachabilities of the components of the given state vector, through a parallel, distributed algorithm. Parallel and distributed algorithms to generate the sum machine and verifying the reachability in it both without exponential complexity are the contributions of this work.},

  abstract = {At present, designers of real-time systems face a dilemma between expressiveness and automatic verification: if they can specify some aspects of their system in some automaton-based formalism, then automatic verification is possible; but more com- plex system components may be hard or impossible to express in such decidable formalisms. These more complex components may still be simulated; but there is then little support for their formal analysis. The main goal of Real-Time Maude is to provide a way out of this dilemma, while complementing both decision pro- cedures and simulation tools. Real-Time Maude emphasizes ease and generality of specification, including support for distributed real-time object-based systems. Because of its generality, falling outside of decidable system classes, the formal anal- yses supported\textemdash including symbolic simulation, breadth-first search for failures of safety properties, and model checking of time-bounded temporal logic properties\textemdash{} are in general incomplete (although they are complete for discrete time). These analysis techniques have been shown useful in finding subtle bugs of complex sys- tems, clearly outside the scope of current decision procedures. This paper describes both the semantics of Real-Time Maude specifications, and of the formal analyses supported by the tool. It also explains the tool's pragmatics, both in the use of its features, and in its application to concrete examples.},

  abstract = {Context: There is a lack of empirical evidence on the differences between model-driven development (MDD), where code is automatically derived from conceptual models, and traditional software development method, where code is manually written. In our previous work, we compared both methods in a baseline experiment concluding that quality of the software developed following MDD was significantly better only for more complex problems (with more function points). Quality was measured through test cases run on a functional system. Objective: This paper reports six replications of the baseline to study the impact of problem complexity on software quality in the context of MDD. Method: We conducted replications of two types: strict replications and object replications. Strict replications were similar to the baseline, whereas we used more complex experimental objects (problems) in the object replications. Results: MDD yields better quality independently of problem complexity with a moderate effect size. This effect is bigger for problems that are more complex. Conclusions: Thanks to the bigger size of the sample after aggregating replications, we discovered an effect that the baseline had not revealed due to the small sample size. The baseline results hold, which suggests that MDD yields better quality for more complex problems.},

In industrial automation domain, continuous research on CPS technologies has been funded strategically and globally. One important research challenge in industrial CPS is the modelling of physical processes in continuous domains connected with control systems in discrete domains. Such co-modelling must leverage state-of-the-art standards and tools for practicality. One feasible combination is the IEC 61499 standard for event-driven control and the Ptolemy II platform for heterogeneous model composition. Furthermore, by implementing the computational models of IEC 61499 in Ptolemy II, the behavioural discrepancies of the same IEC 61499 application under different execution semantics can be analysed. As a foundation work towards these goals, this paper investigates the principles of modelling basic IEC 61499 elements using existing Ptolemy II structures. It is aimed to provide some initial insights for engineering industrial CPS based on IEC 61499 and Ptolemy II.},

  abstract = {Enhancing productivity for designing complex embedded systems requires system level design methodology and language support for capturing complex design in high level models. For an effective methodology, efficiency of simulation and a sound refinement based implementation path are also necessary. Although some of the recent system level design languages for system level abstractions, several essential ingredients are missing from these. We consider (i) explicit support for multiple models of computation (MoCs) or heterogeneity; (ii) the ability to build complex behaviors by hierarchically composing simpler behaviors; and (iii) hierarchical composition of behaviors that belong to distinct models of computation, as essential for successful SLDLs. These render an SLDL with modeling fidelity that exploits both heterogeneity and hierarchy and allows for simpler modeling and efficient simulation. One important requirement for such an SLDL should be that the simulation semantics be also compositional, and hence no flattening of hierarchically composed behaviors be needed for simulation. In this paper we show how we designed SystemC extensions to provide facilities for heterogeneous behavioral hierarchy, compositional simulation semantics, and implemented a simulation kernel which we show experimentally as up to 50\% more efficient than standard SystemC simulation.},

To fully exploit MLM techniques, we need powerful model composition operators. Indeed, the composition of DSMLs is becoming increasingly relevant to the modelling community either because some DSMLs may share commonalities that we want to make reusable, or because we want to facilitate interoperability between DSMLs. In this paper, we propose a composition mechanism for structure and behaviour of multilevel modelling hierarchies. Our approach facilitates the inclusion of additional features while keeping a clear separation of concerns that enhances modularity. We provide a formal semantics of the constructions based on category theory and graph transformations and show their use in practice on a case study.},

One way to specify the behaviour description of MLMs is by means of multilevel model transformations. In this paper, we propose an approach to achieve reusability and flexibility in specifying and executing multilevel model transformations. For this purpose, we rely on code-generation and the efficient rewriting logic mechanisms that Maude provides. As a proof of concept, we have developed an infrastructure which combines our MLM tool MultEcore, that facilitates definition of MLM hierarchies and transformations, with Maude, which performs the execution of the transformations on these hierarchies.},

Based on an elaborated theory for the modeling of underspecification with respect to nondeterminism, hierarchical composition, refinement that is compatible with composition, and finally proven correct evolution patterns, we discuss how such a theory can be practically applied for the development of CPS. Through an orchestrated efficient simulation, we can identify potential bottlenecks, function failures, hardware risks, etc. early. All models as well as the simulation take advantage of the compositionality and the timing refinement properties of the theory. In summary, we discuss how the elaborated theory shapes the simulation and the results.},

The usage of these models have resulted in the introduction of a variety of modelling languages and frameworks. Many of these languages and frameworks are based on the Object Management Group's (OMG) Meta-Object Facility (MOF). In addition to their diagrammatic syntax, these languages use the Object Constraint Language to specify constraints that are difficult to specify diagrammatically. In this paper, we argue for a completely diagrammatic specification framework for MDE, where by diagrammatic we mean specification techniques which target graph-based structures. We introduce the Diagram Predicate Framework, which provides a formal diagrammatic approach to modelling based on category theory \textendash{} the mathematics of graph-based structures. The development of a generic and flexible formalisation of metamodelling is the main contribution of the paper.

This paper presents a new formal, diagrammatic approach to compensable workflow modelling, using principles from model-driven engineering (MDE), which combines diagrammatic modelling with formal foundations. The approach extends the Diagram Predicate Framework, which is based on category theory and graph transformations, for the specification of compensable workflow models. The use of MDE technologies is especially important for software in health services delivery where protocols are highly localised and frequently change.

  abstract = {Workflow management tools may be used in many domains, to guide and direct processes, to support monitoring activities and to increase organizational efficiency. In safety critical applications such as healthcare, it is essential that the workflow is error-free, that is, for every run of the workflow, necessary requirements are satisfied and unwanted situations do not occur. However, most tools and frameworks which support workflow specification are not formal enough to allow automated verification and/or are not user-friendly enough for the domain experts to use. In this paper we discuss an extension to a model-driven engineering (MDE) based approach to workflow modelling. Our goals are to provide a framework that can model typical healthcare protocols, by means of a visual tool which can be easily understood by the users (usually clinicians), and to articulate and model check behavioural properties. With this tool, the user can input a workflow model and workflow properties which are defined diagrammatically; the model is automatically transformed to DVE code (the DiVinE model checker's language) and the properties to LTL-formulae. If the workflow model is not valid wrt. a property, the tool provides a visual representation of a path which is a counterexample that can be easily analysed for debugging. The inherent agility of the MDE approach is especially useful in a healthcare setting because workflows, even for widely used clinical guidelines, generally need to be customized to local settings and updated frequently due to changing conditions, new medications or new research.},

  abstract = {Objective: To alleviate the aforementioned drawbacks, we propose a novel Bx approach, called EVL+Strace, which is built using the Epsilon Validation Language (EVL) on a domain-specific trace metamodel (Strace). Furthermore, an Eclipse-based toolkit, called MoDEBiTE, is developed to automatically produce the EVL+Strace artifacts including the specific trace metamodel and transformation code. Method: EVL+Strace exploits the ability of EVL to transform user updates on models from source to target and vice versa, simultaneously. The applied trace metamodel should be specific to the domains of source and target metamodels that prevents illegitimate trace elements. Additionally, it enables developers to specify the transformation concepts more precisely. A running example is applied to explain the components of EVL+Strace and application of MoDEBiTE. Result: EVL+Strace is the first practical interactive approach that can provide important bidirectional features, such as preservation and propagation. A feature model of Bx approaches is applied to compare EVL +Strace with the well-known Bx languages. To show the superiority of EVL+Strace and applicability of MoDEBiTE, a comprehensive evaluation on six case studies is performed. Conclusion: EVL+Strace provides an interactive transformation system to manage update conflicts. It uses the EVL language for defining Bx transformation that has an easy-to-learn syntax. It is developed based on Epsilon, which is a comprehensive and actively updated framework.},

  abstract = {Developing concurrent applications in cooperative environments is an arduous task. This is mainly due to the fact that it is very difficult to specify the synchronized interaction between the entities composing the system. Using coordination models makes this task easier. The latest trends in this area suggest that to manage the successful implementation of complex systems, coordination models must support some key features regarding the coordination constraints: their separated specification, their unanticipated evolution and their dynamic change. However, supporting these features is not only a technical challenge: it must be also guaranteed that the application of a separately specified coordination pattern to a set of encapsulated entities, or the change of the coordination constraints in an already running software system will not produce semantic errors. This is just the problem focused in this paper. In particular, a method for generating formal interpretable specifications reproducing coordinated environments is presented. The method is based on the Coordinated Roles coordination model and makes use of Maude as a formal language. The benefits obtained are: (i) easy specification using the coordination model syntax, (ii) automatic generation of the corresponding formal specification and (iii) simulation of system behaviour.},

The dominance of gap-spotting is surprising, given it is increasingly recognized that theory is made interesting and influential when it challenges assumptions that underlie existing literature.The article discusses why assumption-challenging approaches are rare, and it identifies a range of social norms that favour gap-spotting. Finally, the article proposes some ways of constructing research questions that move beyond gap-spotting, and discusses how these ways are likely to promote more interesting and significant theories.},

Starting with a formal specification model, that captures the functionality of the system at a high abstraction level, it provides formal design-transformation methods for a transparent refinement process of the system model into an implementation model that is optimized for synthesis. The main contribution of this paper is the ForSyDe modeling technique and the formal treatment of transformational design refinement. We introduce process constructors, that cleanly separate the computation part of a process from the synchronization and communication part. We develop the characteristic function for each process type and use it to define semantic preserving and design decision transformations. These transformations are characterized by name, the format of the original process network, the transformed process network, and a design implication. The implication expresses the relation between original and transformed process network by means of the characteristic function. The objective of the refinement process is a model that can be implemented cost efficiently. To this end, process constructors and processes have a hardware and software interpretation which shall facilitate accurate performance and cost estimations. In a study of a digital equalizer example, we illustrate the modeling and refinement process and focus in particular on refinement of the clock domain, communication refinement, and resource sharing.},

However, some studies have presented divergent findings about the usefulness of the smell concept as a tool to support software development tasks. The reasons of these divergences have not been considered because the studies are presented independently. Objective: To synthesize current knowledge related to the usefulness of the smell concept. We focused on empirical studies investigating how smells impact the software development, the code smell effect. Method: A systematic review about the smell effect is carried out. We grouped the primary studies findings in a thematic map. Result: The smell concept does not support the evaluation of quality design in practice activities of software development. There is no strong evidence correlating smells and some important software development attributes, such as effort in maintenance. Moreover, the studies point out that human agreement on smell detection is low. Conclusion: In order to improve analysis on the subject, the area needs to better outline: (i) factors affecting human evaluation of smells; and (ii) a classification of types of smells, grouping them according to relevant characteristics.},

Ensuring that such systems adhere to a provided specification of admissible or desired behavior is essential. Formal model-based testing is often a suitable cost-effective approach. We introduce an extended version of the formalism of symbolic graphs, which encompasses types as well as attributes, for representing states of dynamic systems. Relying on this extension of symbolic graphs, we present a novel formalism of timed graph transformation systems (TGTSs) that supports the model-based development of dynamic real-time systems at an abstract level where possible state changes and delays are specified by graph transformation rules. We then introduce an extended form of the               metric temporal graph logic               (MTGL) with increased expressiveness to improve the applicability of MTGL for the specification of timed graph sequences generated by a TGTS. Based on the metric temporal operators of MTGL and its built-in graph binding mechanics, we express properties on the structure and attributes of graphs as well as on the occurrence of graphs over time that are related by their inner structure. We provide formal support for checking whether a single generated timed graph sequence adheres to a provided MTGL specification. Relying on this logical foundation, we develop a testing framework for TGTSs that are specified using MTGL. Lastly, we apply this testing framework to a running example by using our prototypical implementation in the tool               AutoGraph               .},

  abstract = {Refactoring of information systems is hard, for two reasons. On the one hand, large databases exist which have to be adjusted. On the other hand, many programs access those data. Data and programs all have to be migrated in a consistent manner such that their semantics does not change. This paper addresses the data part of the problem and introduces a model for object-oriented structures, describing the schema level with classes, associations, and inheritance as well as the instance level with objects and links. Positive Horn formulas based on predicates are used to formulate constraints to be obeyed by the schema and instance level, in order to reflect object-oriented structures. Homomorphisms are used for the typing of the instance level as well as for the description of refactorings which specify the addition, folding, and unfolding of schema elements. A categorial framework is presented which allows us to derive instance migrations from schema transformations in such a way that instances of the old schema are automatically migrated into instances of the new schema. The natural use of the pullback functor for unfolding is followed by an initial semantics approach: Instance migration is completed with the help of a co-adjoint functor on arrow categories.},

  abstract = {Since the beginning of software development, making existing software conformant to new demands has always been an important topic. The extension of software by new functionality is facilitated or even made possible by software refactoring: improving the structure of software without changing its behaviour in order to implement additional functionality more easily. Unfortunately, the transformation of object-oriented data and the transformation of object-oriented software is usually examined separately. This work focuses on the transformation of whole object-oriented systems, i. e. of programs, running program instantiations (processes), and associated data. In order to achieve this goal, first a conceptional model for an appropriate description of object-oriented systems is developed. This model is then formalised by a specification with predicates and positive Horn formulas. Analogously to graph transformations, system transformations are then modelled by spans of homomorphisms. The main result of this work is the canonical deduction of the migration of data, programs, and processes from the transformation of the underlying schema, such that the transformation of a whole system can be uniquely determined by the transformation of the schema only. The work is rounded off by the treatment of the composition of transformations and an outlook of possible model extensions.},

  abstract = {The value of verification of cyberphysical systems depends on the relationship between the state of the software and the state of the physical system. This relationship can be complex because of the real-time nature and different timelines of the physical plant, the sensors and actuators, and the software that is almost always concurrent and distributed. In this paper, we study different ways to construct a transition system model for the distributed and concurrent software components of a CPS. The purpose of the transition system model is to enable model checking, an established and widely used verification technique. We describe a logical-time-based transition system model, which is commonly used for verifying programs written in synchronous languages, and derive the conditions under which such a model faithfully reflects physical states. When these conditions are not met (a common situation), a finer-grained event-based transition system model may be required. We propose an approach for formal verification of cyberphysical systems using Lingua Franca, a language designed for programming cyberphysical systems, and Rebeca, an actor-based language designed for model checking distributed event-driven systems. We focus on the cyber part and model a faithful interface to the physical part. Our method relies on the assumption that the alignment of different timelines during the execution of the system is the responsibility of the underlying platforms. We make those assumptions explicit and clear.},

  abstract = {Context: Code smells are assumed to indicate bad design that leads to less maintainable code. However, this assumption has not been investigated in controlled studies with professional software developers. Aim: This paper investigates the relationship between code smells and maintenance effort. Method: Six developers were hired to perform three maintenance tasks each on four functionally equivalent Java systems originally implemented by different companies. Each developer spent three to four weeks. In total, they modified 298 Java files in the four systems. An Eclipse IDE plug-in measured the exact amount of time a developer spent maintaining each file. Regression analysis was used to explain the effort using file properties, including the number of smells. Result: None of the 12 investigated smells was significantly associated with increased effort after we adjusted for file size and the number of changes; Refused Bequest was significantly associated with decreased effort. File size and the number of changes explained almost all of the modeled variation in effort. Conclusion: The effects of the 12 smells on maintenance effort were limited. To reduce maintenance effort, a focus on reducing code size and the work practices that limit the number of changes may be more beneficial than refactoring code smells.},

A bidirectional transformation (bx) is usually defined as a means of maintaining consistency between "two (or more)" models. This includes cases where one model may be generated from one or more others, as well as more complex ("symmetric") cases where models record partially overlapping information. In recent years binary bx, those relating two models, have been extensively studied. Multiary1 bx, those relating more than two models, have received less attention. In this paper we consider how a multiary consistency relation may be defined in terms of binary consistency relations, and how consistency restoration may be carried out on a network of models and relationships between them. We relate this to megamodelling and discuss further research that is needed.},

The majority of these approaches, however, is limited to a binary setting; i.e. the synchronization of exactly two models with each other. A recent Dagstuhl seminar on multidirectional transformations made it clear that there is a need for further investigations in the domain of general multiple model synchronization simply because not every multiary consistency relation can be factored into binary ones. However, with the help of an auxiliary artifact, which provides a global view over all models, multiary synchronization can be achieved by existing binary model synchronization means. In this paper, we propose a novel comprehensive system construction to produce such an artifact using the same underlying base modelling language as the one used to define the models. Our approach is based on the definition of partial commonalities among a set of aligned models. Comprehensive systems can be shown to generalize the underlying categories of graph diagrams and triple graph grammars and can efficiently be implemented in existing tools.},

  abstract = {Software architecture is foundational to the development of large, practical software-intensive applications. This brand-new text covers all facets of software architecture and how it serves as the intellectual centerpiece of software development and evolution. Critically, this text focuses on supporting creation of real implemented systems. Hence the text details not only modeling techniques, but design, implementation, deployment, and system adaptation \textendash{} as well as a host of other topics \textendash{} putting the elements in context and comparing and contrasting them with one another. Rather than focusing on one method, notation, tool, or process, this new text/reference widely surveys software architecture techniques, enabling the instructor and practitioner to choose the right tool for the job at hand. Software Architecture is intended for upper-division undergraduate and graduate courses in software architecture, software design, component-based software engineering, and distributed systems; the text may also be used in introductory as well as advanced software engineering courses.},

In MDE, the model is the primary artifact and serves several goals, including code generation, requirements traceability, and model-based testing. MDE thus enables cost-effective building of models versus direct coding of an application. Thus model-based formal verification of behavioral consistency is desirable as it helps improve model quality. Our approach is based on translation of a UML model to instantiable Petri nets (IPN). This formalism is based on the semantics of Petri nets, but introduces the concepts of type and instance. This allows one to accurately capture these concepts in UML models. IPN support hierarchical descriptions natively, and use the notion of transition synchronization for composition of behaviors. This is a general and powerful mechanism borrowed from process algebra. We show that IPN allow one to adequately address the challenges of translation from UML for analysis purposes. The approach has been implemented and experimental results are presented.},

  abstract = {Model Driven Software Engineering (MDSE) is an established approach for developing complex software systems. The Unified Modelling Language (UML) is one of the most used model languages for applying the MDSE approach. UML has 14 diagram types that describe different perspectives of one software system under development. These diagrams are strongly dependent on each other, and must be consistent with one another. The main objectives of this paper are: (1) to survey the diffusion and relevance of model consistency issues with experts, in order to understand model consistency in the MDSE/UML contexts; and more importantly, (2) to validate a set of 116 UML consistency rules from the literature, so as to identify the rules that should always be enforced. We conducted a personal opinion survey with 106 MDSE experts from academia and industry, by means of an online questionnaire, from May to June 2016. The survey results describe a detailed overview of how the topic of MDSE/UML consistency is addressed in academia and industry. In addition, this survey identified a set of 52 out of 116 UML consistency rules which should always be checked in every UML model. This subset of 52 rules could be: (a) considered to be added to the UML standard, (b) used as a reference to researchers who study UML/MDSE, (c) used as a practical example for teaching purposes.},

Method We conducted a systematic literature review. We used the keyword-based search on Google Scholar, and we identified 618 potentially relevant studies; after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 96 papers were selected for further analysis. Results The main findings/contributions are: (i) a list of available tools used to support model management; (ii) 40\% of the tools can provide consistency checking on models of different domains and 25\% on models of the same domain, and 35\% do not provide any consistency checking; (iii) available strategies to keep the consistency between models of different domains are not mature enough; (iv) most of the tools that provide consistency checking on models of different domains can only capture up to two inconsistency types; (v) the main challenges associated with tools that manage models on different domains are related to interoperability between tools and the consistency maintenance. Conclusion The results presented in this study can be used to guide new research on maintaining the consistency between models of different domains. Example of further research is to investigate how to capture the Behavioral and Refinement inconsistency types. This study also indicates that the tools should be improved in order to address, for example, more kinds of consistency check.},

  abstract = {UML diagrams describe different views of one piece of software. These diagrams strongly depend on each other and must therefore be consistent with one another, since inconsistencies between diagrams may be a source of faults during software development activities that rely on these diagrams. It is therefore paramount that consistency rules be defined and that inconsistencies be detected, analyzed and fixed. The relevant literature shows that authors typically define their own UML consistency rules, sometimes defining the same rules and sometimes defining rules that are already in the UML standard. The reason might be that no consolidated set of rules that are deemed relevant by authors can be found to date. The aim of our research is to provide a consolidated set of UML consistency rules and obtain a detailed overview of the current research in this area. We therefore followed a systematic procedure in order to collect and analyze UML consistency rules. We then consolidated a set of 116 UML consistency rules (avoiding redundant definitions or definitions already in the UML standard) that can be used as an important reference for UML-based software development activities, for teaching UML-based software development, and for further research.},

Method: We performed a Systematic Mapping Study by following well-known guidelines. We selected 95 primary studies from a search with seven search engines performed in December 2012. Results: Different results are worth mentioning. First it appears that researchers tend to discuss very similar consistency rules, over and over again. Most rules are horizontal (98.10\%) and syntactic (88.21\%). The most used diagrams are the class diagram (71.58\%), the sequence diagram (47.37\%) and the state machine diagram (42.11\%). Conclusion: The fact that many rules are duplicated in primary studies confirms the need for a well-accepted list of consistency rules. This paper is a first step in this direction. Results indicate that much more work is needed to develop consistency rules for all 14 UML diagrams, in all dimensions of consistency (e.g., semantic and syntactic on the one hand, horizontal, vertical and evolution on the other hand).},

It offers heterogeneous modeling capabilities by allowing different models of computation, both untimed and timed, to be composed hierarchically in an arbitrary fashion. This paper proposes a formal semantics for Ptolemy that is modular in the sense that atomic actors and their compositions are treated in a unified way. In particular, all actors conform to an executable interface that contains four functions: fire (produce outputs given current state and inputs); postfire (update state instantaneously); deadline (how much time the actor is willing to let elapse); and time-update (update the state with the passage of time). Composite actors are obtained using composition operators that in Ptolemy are called directors. Different directors realise different models of computation. In this paper, we formally define the directors for the following models of computation: synchronous- reactive, discrete event, continuous time, process networks and modal models.},

Method: The formalization consists of in-place graph transformation rules that are documented visually using BPMN syntax. In-place transformations update models directly and do not require mappings to other languages. We have used a mature tool and test-suite to develop a reference implementation of all rules. Results: Our formalization is a promising complement to the standard, in particular because all rules have been extensively verified and because conceptual validation is facilitated (the informal semantics also describes in-place updates). Conclusion: Since our formalization has already revealed problems with the standard and since the BPMN is still evolving, the maintainers of the standard can benefit from our results. Moreover, tool vendors can use our formalization and reference implementation for verifying conformance to the standard.},

In modeldriven engineering, the coordination of behavioral models to produce a single integrated model is necessary to provide support for validation and verification. Indeed, it allows system designers to understand and validate the global and emerging behavior of the system. However, the manual coordination of models is tedious and error-prone, and current approaches to automate the coordination are bound to a fixed set of coordination patterns. In this paper, we propose a Behavioral Coordination Operator Language (B-COOL) to reify coordination patterns between specific domains by using coordination operators between the Domain-Specific Modeling Languages used in these domains. Those operators are then used to automate the coordination of models conforming to these languages. We illustrate the use of B-COOL with the definition of coordination operators between timed finite state machines and activity diagrams.},

  abstract = {Workflows are used to organize business processes, and workflow management tools are used to guide users in which order these processes should be performed. These tools increase organizational efficiency and enable users to focus on the tasks and activities rather than complex processes. Workflow models represent real life workflows and consist mainly of a graph-based structure where nodes represent tasks and arrows represent the flows between these tasks. From workflow models, one can use model transformations to generate workflow software. The correctness of the software is dependent on the correctness of the models, hence verification of the models against certain properties like termination, liveness and absence of deadlock are crucial in safety critical domains like healthcare. In previous works we presented a formal diagrammatic framework for workflow modelling and verification which uses principles from model-driven engineering. The framework uses a metamodelling approach for the specification of workflow models, and a transformation module which creates DiVinE code used for verification of model properties. In this paper, in order to improve the scalability and efficiency of the verification, we introduce a new encoding of the workflow models using the Alloy specification language, and we present a bounded verification approach for workflow models based on relational logic. We automatically translate the workflow metamodel into a model transformation specification in Alloy. Properties of the workflow can then be verified against the specification; especially, we can verify properties about loops. We use a running example to explain the metamodelling approach and the encoding to Alloy.},

Any comparison between process models relies on a mapping that identifies which activity in one model corresponds to which activity in another. Tools that generate such mappings are called matchers. This paper presents the ICoP framework, which can be used to develop such matchers. It consists of an architecture and re-usable matcher components. The framework enables the creation of matchers from the re-usable components and, if desired, newly developed components. It focuses on matchers that also detect complex correspondences between groups of activities, where existing matchers focus on 1:1 correspondences. We evaluate the framework by applying it to find matches in process models from practice. We show that the framework can be used to develop matchers in a flexible and adaptable manner and that the resulting matchers can identify a significant number of complex correspondences.},

In the context of railway systems engineering, system verification is of major importance as software failures can cause serious damage. At DB Netz AG, a railway infrastructure manager that operates large parts of the German railway system, the challenge of enabling both high-level system modelling and formal system verification is addressed by employing SysML, a widespread systems modelling language, and Event-B, a formal systems modelling language particularly suited for automated system verification. In the currently applied completely manual development process, engineers (i) create models using SysML, (ii) translate relevant parts of these models to Event-B for verification, (iii) possibly improve the Event-B models based on verification results, and finally (iv) reflect these improvements in the original SysML models. This process is both tedious and error-prone, clearly indicating a need for an increase in the level of automation.},

  abstract = {Managing models in a consistent manner is an important task in the field of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE). Although restoring and maintaining consistency is desired in general, recent work has pointed out that always strictly enforcing consistency at any point of time is often not feasible in real-world scenarios, and sometimes even contrary to what a user expects from a trustworthy MDE tool. The challenge of tolerating inconsistencies has been discussed from different viewpoints within and outside the modelling community, but there exists no structured overview of existing and current work in this regard. In this paper, we provide such an overview to help join forces tackling the unresolved problems of tolerating inconsistencies in MDE. We follow the standard process of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to point out what tolerance means, how it relates to uncertainty, which examples for tolerant software systems have already been discussed, and which benefits and drawbacks tolerating inconsistencies entails. Furthermore, we propose a tool-chain that helps conducting SLRs in computer science and also eases the reproduction of results. Relevant meta-data of the collected sources is uniformly described in a textual modelling language and exported to the graph database Neo4j to query aggregated information.},

Graph transformations provide a unified approach for aspect modeling in that the methods presented here can be applied to any modeling language with a well-defined metamodel. This paper, however, focuses on UML class diagrams, sequence diagrams and state diagrams. MATA takes a different approach to AOM since there are no explicit joinpoints. Rather, any model element can be a joinpoint, and composition is a special case of model transformation. The graph transformation execution engine, AGG, is used in MATA to execute model compositions, and critical pair analysis is used to automatically detect structural interactions between different aspect models. MATA has been applied to a number of realistic case studies and is supported by a tool built on top of IBM Rational Software Modeler.},

The static semantics of a sequence diagram is to check whether it is consistent with the class diagram declaration as well as with its well-formed tree structure. Meanwhile, the dynamic semantics is defined in terms of the state transitions that are carried out by the method invocations in the diagram. When a message is executed, it must be consistent with system state, i.e., object diagram and the state diagrams of its related objects. The semantics clearly captures the consistency between sequence diagram with class diagram and state diagram. Therefore, it is useful to develop the model consistent checking functions in UML CASE tools. And it also can be used to reason about the correctness of a design model with respect to a requirement model.},

  abstract = {To aid the development of high quality software applications, we present an approach for consistency checking of UML dynamic models based on Petri Net techniques. ECPN, an Extended Colored Petri Net, is used to formally describe state transitions of individual objects and interactions among objects, and is therefore capable of verifying the consistency of the models based on Petri Net theory. In this work, we consider UML sequence diagrams and statecharts. The approach begins with a flattening strategy for UML dynamic models and then discusses translation of statecharts with composite states to an ECPN notation. The coverability graph is used to drive the consistency checking process. The paper discusses all phases of the approach and illustrates the concept by an example.},

  abstract = {Our objectives here are to discuss the development of a formal framework that exploits the advantages of the discrete event system specification (DEVS) formalism and builds upon recent extensive work on verification combining DEVS and model checking for hybrid systems. DEVS offers the ability, via mathematical transformations called system morphisms, to map a system expressed in a formalism suitable for analysis (e.g., timed automata or hybrid automata) into the DEVS formalism for the purpose of simulation. We discuss a probabilistic extension of the FD-DEVS formalism that enables a set of model classes and tools derived from Markov-type models. The MS4 modelling environment provides a suite of tools that support this extension, called FP-DEVS. In this paper, we describe these tools and the concepts underlying them. We also provide examples of application of these concepts and discuss the open opportunities for research in this direction.},

  abstract = {The Data Display Debugger (DDD) is a novel graphical user interface to GDB and DBX, the popular UNIX debuggers. Besides "usual" features such as viewing source texts and breakpoints, DDD provides a graphical data display, where data structures are displayed as graphs. A simple mouse click dereferences pointers or reveals structure contents. Complex data structures can be explored incrementally and interactively, using automatic layout if preferred. Each time the program stops, the data display reflects the current variable values. DDD has been designed to compete with well-known commercial debuggers; however, it is free software, protected by the GNU general public license. In this paper, we give a quick presentation of DDD and describe its architecture and basic functionality from a technical point of view.},

  abstract = {Discrete-event (DE) models are formal system specifications that have analyzable deterministic behaviors. Using a global, consistent notion of time, DE components communicate via time-stamped events. DE models have primarily been used in performance modeling and simulation, where time stamps are a modeling property bearing no relationship to real time during execution of the model. In this paper, we extend DE models with the capability of relating certain events to physical time. We propose a programming model, called PTIDES (Programming Temporally Integrated Distributed Embedded Systems), which has DE semantics, but with carefully chosen relations between model time and real time. Key to making this model effective is to ensure that constraints that guarantee determinacy in the semantics are preserved at runtime. To accomplish this, we give a distributed execution strategy that obeys DE semantics without the penalty of totally ordered executions based on time stamps. Our technique relies on having a distributed common notion of time, known to some precision. Based on causality analysis of DE models, we define relevant dependency and relevant orders to enable out-of-order execution without compromising determinism and without requiring backtracking.},
